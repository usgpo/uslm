# USLM Schema #  
In support of the United States Legislative Branch XML Working Group and in accordance with [2 U.S.C. 181](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/2/181), the Government Publishing Office (GPO) is making the United States Legislative Markup (USLM) XML schema available as an authoritative source on GitHub. 


## Schema Versions ##  
Approved versions of the schema are in the main branch. If there are proposed changes to the schema, the changes will be in a proposed branch as a new draft version of the schema. A major.minor.point structure is used to identify the schema version, and the schema version is recorded as an attribute at the root level. The point number is incremented to indicate a non-breaking change while the minor number is incremented to indicate a breaking change. Breaking changes will only be implemented after all other options have been exhausted. Please refer to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a summary of changes.  


## Proposed Branch ##  
As needed, a proposed branch will be created from the main branch. In addition to the files from the main branch, the proposed branch may also contain draft versions of the USLM 2.x schema, draft sample files, and draft CSS files.   

 
## User Guide and Review Guide ##  
Please refer to the USLM User Guide in [PDF](USLM-User-Guide.pdf) or [Markdown](USLM-User-Guide.md) and the USLM 2.x Review Guide in [PDF](USLM-2_0-Review-Guide-v2_0_12.pdf) or [Markdown](USLM-2_0-Review-Guide-v2_0_12.md) for additional information about the schema.
