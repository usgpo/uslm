The persimmons will also have to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate with an additional declaration stating that they were produced under, and meet all the components of, the systems approach and were inspected and found to be free of quarantine pests in accordance with the requirements. This action allows the importation of fresh persimmons from New Zealand while continuing to protect against the introduction of plant pests into the United States.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2016-08-26">August 26, 2016</date>, we published in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> (<ref href="/us/fr/81/58870">81 FR 58870</ref>–58873, Docket No. APHIS–2015–0052) a proposal <ref id="fnd4e64" idref="fnd4e73" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref> to amend the fruits and vegetables regulations to allow the importation of fresh persimmons (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Diospyros kaki</inline> Thunb.) from New Zealand into the United States.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We solicited comments concerning our proposal for 60 days ending <date date="2016-10-25">October 25, 2016</date>. We received two comments by that date, from a private citizen and the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of New Zealand. One commenter generally objected to the importation of all fruits and vegetables into the United States, but did not otherwise address any issues germane to the proposal. The other comment is discussed in greater detail below.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In paragraph (d)(3) of the proposal, we proposed to require that diseased or insect-infested fruit and fruit with surface pests be culled either before or during packing and removed from the packinghouse. We also proposed to require that the culling include any damaged or deformed fruit. The NPPO of New Zealand stated that the removal of deformed fruit is a grading concern rather than a phytosanitary issue.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We disagree. As explained in the proposed rule, deformed fruit is more susceptible to infestation, as is damaged fruit.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In paragraph (d)(4), we proposed to require that shipping containers be marked to identify the place of production and packinghouse from which the consignment of fruit originated. The NPPO of New Zealand asked for clarification of the term “final shipping container,” which we used in the preamble of the proposed rule. The NPPO stated that each individual packed unit of New Zealand persimmons will be marked to identify the place of production and packinghouse from which the packed unit of fruit originated.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Our use of the term “final shipping container” was intended to refer to the individually packed units of the consignment and not the container in which the individually packed units are shipped. We have amended the text of paragraph (d)(4) to clarify that.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In paragraph (e), we proposed to require that inspectors from the NPPO of New Zealand visually inspect a sample of fruit from each consignment at a rate jointly agreed upon by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the NPPO of New Zealand, and cut fruit to inspect for quarantine pests that are internal feeders. The NPPO of New Zealand stated that, because there are no quarantine pests that are internal feeders on persimmons in New Zealand, cutting of fruit is not necessary.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As described in the pest risk assessment, there are seven Lepidoptera pests of quarantine significance present in New Zealand that could be introduced into the United States through the importation of fresh persimmons. The larvae of some or all of these pests, which are classified as leafroller moths, may bore into the fruit and feed internally. Evidence of infestation, including entrance holes and frass, would easily be detected during visual inspection except for the extensive calyx on persimmon fruit. Therefore, we proposed to require fruit cutting as an addition to visual inspection. We agree that fruit cutting is not necessary as long as the area of the fruit under the calyx is thoroughly examined for the presence of internally <?page num="45956"?>feeding pests. Therefore, we are amending the language in paragraph (e) to state that fruit cutting will be required only when visual evidence of internally feeding insects is discovered.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In paragraph (c)(2), we proposed to require that the NPPO of New Zealand or its approved designee visit and inspect the places of production monthly beginning at blossom drop and continuing until the end of the shipping season for quarantine pests. In paragraph (f), we also proposed that the persimmons be treated with hot water treatment or with modified atmosphere treatment by being packed in semi-permeable polymeric bags and stored at 0 °C for a minimum of 28 days. The NPPO of New Zealand stated that, because the persimmons will undergo a 28-day cold treatment prior to export, by the time persimmons are shipped, there will not be any persimmons in the place of production to inspect.








 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We agree with the commenter and are amending paragraph (c)(2) to state that inspection of places of production will continue until the end of the harvest season rather than the end of the shipping season.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Therefore, for the reasons given in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the proposed rule as a final rule, with the changes discussed in this document.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This final rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref> and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. Further, because this rule is not significant, it is not a regulatory action under <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, we have analyzed the potential economic effects of this action on small entities. The analysis is summarized below. Copies of the full analysis are available on the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Regulations.gov</inline> Web site (see footnote 1 in this document for a link to <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Regulations.gov</inline>) or by contacting the person listed under <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-2">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</inline>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">APHIS is amending the regulations in <ref href="/us/cfr/t7/s319.56">7 CFR 319.56</ref>, to allow the importation of fresh persimmon fruit (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Diospyros kaki</inline>) into the entire United States from New Zealand subject to a systems approach. Most U.S. persimmon production takes place in California, where the 2011 value of production totaled about $13.6 million. The most recent data on U.S. persimmon imports show a total value of about $4.4 million in 2015.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The wholesale value of the persimmon fruit for which New Zealand has requested import access will be about $90,000 initially. The value of future imports is forecast to reach about $330,000, or about 2 percent of the U.S. persimmon market.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Small Business Administration's (SBA) small-entity standard for entities involved in fruit farming is $750,000 or less in annual receipts (NAICS 111339). It is probable that most or all U.S. persimmon producers are small businesses by the SBA standard. We expect any impact of the rule for these entities will be minimal, given New Zealand's expected small share of the U.S. persimmon market.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This final rule allows fresh persimmons to be imported into the United States from New Zealand. State and local laws and regulations regarding fresh persimmons imported under this rule will be preempted while the fruit is in foreign commerce. Fresh fruits are generally imported for immediate distribution and sale to the consuming public, and remain in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases must be addressed on a case-by-case basis.

Subtitle I, Section 106 describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's authority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that authority as it establishes Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Highland Community Hospital Heliport, Picayune, MS, to support IFR operations under standard instrument approach procedures at the heliport.

Therefore, this regulation: (1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>; (2) is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (<ref href="/us/fr/44/11034">44 FR 11034</ref>; <date date="1979-02-26">February 26, 1979</date>); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that only affects air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Therefore, this regulation: (1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>; (2) is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (<ref href="/us/fr/44/11034">44 FR 11034</ref>; <date date="1979-02-26">February 26, 1979</date>); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that only affects air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This rule revises the authority paragraphs for the 23 affected parts of the EAR to remove references to the previous notice and add references to the most recent such notice, which the President signed on <date date="2017-08-15">August 15, 2017</date>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This rule is purely procedural and makes no changes other than to revise CFR authority paragraphs for the purpose of making the authority citations current.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Rulemaking Requirements
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">1. Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). This rule does not impose any regulatory burden on the public and is consistent with the goals of <ref href="/us/eo/13563">Executive Order 13563</ref>. This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>. This rule is not an <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref> regulatory action because this rule is not significant under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person is required to respond to, nor shall any person be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with, a collection of information subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (<ref href="/us/usc/t44/s3501">44 U.S.C. 3501</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.</inline>) (PRA), unless that collection of information displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number. This rule does not involve any collection of information.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications as that term is defined under <ref href="/us/eo/13132">Executive Order 13132</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">4. The Department finds that there is good cause under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)</ref> to waive the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act requiring prior notice and the opportunity for public comment because they are unnecessary. This rule only updates legal authority citations. It clarifies information and is non-discretionary. This rule does not alter any right, obligation or prohibition that applies to any person under the EAR. Because these revisions are not substantive changes, it is unnecessary to provide notice and opportunity for public comment. In addition, the 30-day delay in effectiveness otherwise required by <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/d">5 U.S.C. 553(d)</ref> is not applicable because this rule is not a substantive rule. Because neither the Administrative Procedure Act nor any other law requires that notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule, the analytical requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s601">5 U.S.C. 601</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.</inline>) are not applicable. Accordingly, no Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is required and none has been prepared.

BOEM reviewed these comments, categorized and organized them by subject, and has provided responses to those substantive comments in Section III below. These comments are available for viewing in their original form on <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">www.regulations.gov</inline> by searching for the term: “BOEM AD90.” BOEM also renumbered the sections contained in the proposed rule to facilitate any later amendments that may be necessary. Finally, BOEM altered the title of the proposed rule by replacing “Leasing” with “Agreements” to more accurately reflect the types of instruments BOEM uses to convey offshore sand, gravel, and/or shell resources (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.</inline> leases or memoranda of agreement, as described below).

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Congress amended the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, <ref href="/us/usc/t43/s1331–1356">43 U.S.C. 1331–1356</ref> (OCSLA), in 1994 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to negotiate noncompetitive agreements with any person for the use of OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources in a program of, or project for, shore protection, beach restoration, or coastal wetlands restoration undertaken by a Federal, state, or local government agency, or in a construction project either authorized by, or funded in whole or in part by the Federal Government. See <ref href="/us/usc/t43/s1337/k/2">43 U.S.C. 1337(k)(2)</ref>. In negotiating an agreement for use of the OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources, OCSLA provides that “the Secretary may assess a fee based on an assessment of the value of the resources and the public interest served by promoting development of the resources.” However, the same provision of OCSLA also states that no fee will be assessed directly or indirectly against a Federal, state, or local government agency. See <ref href="/us/usc/t43/s1337/k/2/B">43 U.S.C. 1337(k)(2)(B)</ref>.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">A. Program Description
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Generally, shore protection and beach and coastal wetlands restoration projects are initiated to rebuild eroding shoreline segments, such as beaches and dunes, barrier islands, and wetlands. In sensitive wetland areas, these projects are intended to forestall further erosion, restore habitat and/or to provide protection from hurricanes and storms. These projects are typically accomplished by placing sand, gravel, or shell resources directly on the beach, in open water areas that are the location of an eroded beach, and/or within breaches in the shoreline that compromise the integrity of the beach or barrier island system or its capacity to form, and subsequently maintain, a beach. Material may also be placed updrift from the beach, allowing longshore processes to redistribute the <?page num="45963"?>sand, gravel, and/or shell resources along the beach.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">OCSLA authorizes BOEM to enter into a negotiated noncompetitive agreement when the use of OCS sand, gravel, <?GPOnewLine?>and/or shell resources is authorized for qualifying projects. This negotiated agreement may take the form of a lease or a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), depending upon the type of applicant(s) requesting use of OCS sand, gravel, <?GPOnewLine?>and/or shell resources. If a non-Federal entity requests the use of OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources, the negotiated noncompetitive agreement required by OCSLA would generally take the form of a lease. If a Federal agency requests the use of OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources, BOEM and the Federal agency, as well as their Federal, state, or local government agency counterparts on the project, would enter into an MOA. For example, when a Federal agency partially or wholly funds a non-Federal entity to conduct a project that is otherwise eligible for OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources, the negotiated noncompetitive agreement may take the form of a three-party MOA. As warranted, the Federal applicant(s) and BOEM would designate a lead agency and enter into a cooperating agency agreement for the environmental analysis and review of the proposed project. Likewise, if another Federal agency is not involved, BOEM would ensure that appropriate environmental analysis and review is completed. The negotiated noncompetitive agreement in each of these situations would describe the project and procedures that would be followed, and identify environmental and administrative requirements that must be met. As described in Section III below in response to a comment received, the requirements and processes for entering into a negotiated noncompetitive agreement are the same whether the agreement takes the form of a lease or a MOA. The only distinction is that which Congress provides in OCSLA that, when these projects involve Federal agencies, the Federal agency “shall enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Secretary. . . .” See <ref href="/us/usc/t43/s1337/k/2/D">43 U.S.C. 1337(k)(2)(D)</ref>.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">BOEM and its predecessor agencies—the Minerals Management Service and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement—through the Marine Minerals Program, have been exercising statutory authority regarding OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources under OCSLA pursuant to written guidelines, without the benefit of implementing regulations. BOEM has negotiated over 50 noncompetitive agreements, providing for the use of more than 100 million cubic yards of OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources for shore protection, beach restoration, or coastal wetlands restoration projects undertaken by a Federal, state, or local government agency, and for federally authorized or funded construction projects. BOEM believes that promulgation of regulations at this time is advisable to provide additional clarity and certainty and to help ensure continuity of the Marine Minerals Program.

This section explains that the rule applies exclusively to the negotiated noncompetitive use of sand, gravel, <?GPOnewLine?>and/or shell resources on the OCS and does not apply to competitive leasing of minerals, including oil, gas, sulphur, geopressured-geothermal and associated resources, and all other minerals that are authorized by an Act of Congress to be produced from “public lands” as defined in section 103 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended (FLPMA).

BOEM has negotiated over 50 agreements, providing for the use of more than 100 million cubic yards of OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources for shore protection, beach restoration, or coastal wetlands restoration. This final rule codifies the procedures BOEM has used to implement this program for many years and ensures consistency as the program continues to process requests for use of OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources and manage these resources into the future.

The criteria BOEM uses in evaluating an application are provided in Section 583.305. BOEM does not assign a weight to each criterion but considers each criterion in the context of the entire proposed project, as well as pending requests for other projects in the same or nearby borrow areas.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The timelines for processing applications and requests vary based upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, completion of necessary environmental analyses (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> through the NEPA process) and consultation processes (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> Tribal consultations or ESA consultations). The environmental review process can range from six months to a year or more. The duration of the environmental review is variable and can be influenced by many factors that can drive different timeframes, including the scope and issues of a project, type of environmental review needed (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) under NEPA), applicability of reviews or consultations previously completed, additional information or studies that may be necessary, emergent stakeholder concerns, and whether or not another Federal partner is leading, or <?page num="45966"?>cooperating on, the environmental review and consultations. Once the environmental reviews and consultations are completed, it may take up to an additional six months to complete the process for issuing a final agreement, as project-specific stipulations in the agreement are negotiated between the applicant(s) and BOEM.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Because every project must be evaluated using a number of factors and project-specific information, BOEM determined that it is not possible to modify the rule as requested by the commenters. Providing specific weighting of criteria or providing an inflexible review deadline would be unnecessarily restrictive given the complexities of evaluating individual, site specific projects while complying with multiple statutes governing environmental review and consultation.

BOEM will be unable, however, to formally solicit additional expressions of interest each time it receives an application because the applicable statutory provision governing agreements issued pursuant to these regulations specifically provides for a noncompetitive process where agreements are negotiated on a qualifying program or project basis. See <ref href="/us/usc/t43/s1337/k/2">43 U.S.C. 1337(k)(2)</ref>. Public notice of projects will be provided through the BOEM Web site and, as appropriate, during the public participation process of NEPA; the permitting process for authorized U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) civil works projects, through the USACE Section 404 permitting process, where applicable; and through BOEM engagement during stakeholder outreach and government-to-government consultations. In addition, to facilitate stakeholder awareness and engagement, BOEM holds annual regional Sand Management Working Group meetings in close consultation with the states to understand future projected OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resource needs. BOEM seeks to make its process a collaborative effort that involves all interested stakeholders, where appropriate.

See <ref href="/us/usc/t43/s1337/k/2">43 U.S.C. 1337(k)(2)</ref>. BOEM does not reimburse parties for independent studies conducted on the OCS.

In BOEM negotiated agreements, BOEM expressly reserves the right to authorize other uses in the designated borrow area that will not unreasonably interfere with activities authorized under the agreement. BOEM allows parties to an agreement to review and comment on any proposed authorizations for use of OCS sand resources in the designated borrow area while their agreement is in effect.

BOEM, with the support of its sister agency the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), will enforce the provisions of the lease and will take appropriate enforcement actions, if necessary. The new regulation section 583.300(a) specifically requires that the applicant detail how the material will be used and how it qualifies as an eligible project. Staging of the OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources onshore for ultimate use in a qualified project or program may be approved so long as the resources are ultimately used for the qualified project identified in the agreement, during the agreement term. However, the sale of excess material not needed for the project would not be a qualified use of the OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources and would therefore not be an authorized use.

Therefore, the final rule includes BOEM's standard process of allowing unsuccessful applicants, whose request was disapproved or disqualified by the Regional Director or equivalent, to seek reconsideration by the Director. This final rule provides for a reconsideration process for decisions on negotiated noncompetitive agreements under <ref href="/us/usc/t43/s1337/k">43 U.S.C. 1337(k)</ref>.

A longer maximum agreement term could serve as an incentive for agencies or authorities to seek authorizations for highly speculative projects far into the future that may be unlikely to be funded or that would change significantly in scope and require additional environmental analysis in the future. Therefore, BOEM selected five years as the maximum term for negotiated noncompetitive agreements, which considers the lead times needed for a project applicant to obtain an agreement and enter into related construction contracts. There must be some reasonable time limit within which BOEM expects the resources to be used and the project completed to fulfill the Bureau's statutory obligations and manage the resources responsibly for multiple stakeholders.

BOEM's Tribal Liaison Officer has certified that this regulation does not have tribal implications as defined in section 1(a) of <ref href="/us/eo/13175">E.O. 13175</ref> and has determined that the regulation does not have substantial and direct effects on federally recognized tribes or any Alaska Native Corporation established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) (<ref href="/us/usc/t43/s1601">43 U.S.C. 1601</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.</inline>)

The existing policies, procedures, consultations and monitoring requirements for the noncompetitive use of OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources are longstanding and have remained relatively consistent for two decades. If BOEM determines an individual project authorized under this part may have effects on federally recognized tribes or any Alaska Native Corporation, BOEM will initiate consultation as soon as possible consistent with <ref href="/us/eo/13175">E.O. 13175</ref> and DOI tribal consultation policies.

Collections of information include requests and requirements that an individual, partnership, or corporation obtain information, and report it to a Federal Agency (<ref href="/us/usc/t44/s3502">44 U.S.C. 3502</ref>; <ref href="/us/cfr/t5/s1320.2/c">5 CFR 1320.2(c)</ref> and (k)).

The final rule adds a new part 583 to address the use of OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources for shore protection or replenishment, wetland restoration, or qualified construction projects. This part describes the negotiated noncompetitive agreement process for qualifying projects and codifies procedures.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The title of the IC request is “<ref href="/us/cfr/t30/p583">30 CFR 583</ref>, Negotiated Noncompetitive Agreements for the Use of Sand, Gravel, and Shell Resources on the OCS.” Respondents are other Federal, state, and local government agencies; corporations; and individual entities. Responses will primarily be required to obtain or retain a benefit. The frequency of response will vary depending on the requirement. BOEM will protect proprietary information according to <ref href="/us/cfr/t30/s550.197">30 CFR 550.197</ref>, “Data and information to be made available to the public or for limited inspection,” the Freedom of Information Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s552">5 U.S.C. 552</ref>) and its implementing regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t43/p2">43 CFR part 2</ref>.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In response to the proposed rule, BOEM received two comments that addressed aspects of the information collection for this rulemaking and are summarized below. One commenter suggested that the required information submitted with their permit application is duplicative of the information submitted in a Clean Water Act application. In cases where the information is duplicative in nature, BOEM will allow submission of the information in the Clean Water Act permit application to BOEM to comply with the filing requirements of this rule. However, BOEM did not change the burden hours for this requirement, because we do not have sufficient data to estimate how many parties seeking agreements will be able to use this means of reducing the burdens of the application process. This comment is addressed in more detail in the preamble of this final rule.

This commenter stated that the information request does not include any provision requiring consultation with the fishing industry or reporting requirements that would ensure a project is compatible with consideration of fishing rights. However, such outreach and coordination does occur through the NEPA, MSFCMA and other consultation processes.

The agreement will specify, at a minimum, who may use the OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources; the nature of the rights granted, including any terms and conditions and environmental stipulations; and the location, type, and <?page num="45975"?>volume of OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources. An authorization to use OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources identified in an agreement is not exclusive; BOEM may allow other entities to use OCS sand, gravel, and/or shell resources from the same borrow area if these uses are determined by BOEM to be non-conflicting and do not exceed the availability of the OCS resource.

This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)</ref>, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because it is impracticable.

The NPRM process would delay the establishment of the special local regulation until after the scheduled date of the marine event and jeopardize public safety.

Delaying this rule would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest because immediate action is necessary to protect persons and property from the dangers associated with the marine event.

This rule has not been designated a “significant regulatory action,” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>.

The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s605/b">5 U.S.C. 605(b)</ref> that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)</ref>, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because it is impracticable. This event is among the annual recurring events listed in <ref href="/us/cfr/t33/s100.801">33 CFR 100.801</ref>, Table 1, line no. 65, between mile marker (MM) 190.0 to MM 195.0, as occuring on the last weekend in September. This year, the dates of the event have been changed by the event organizer to the first weekend in October.

The purpose of this rulemaking is to ensure the safety of life and vessels on these navigable waters before, during, and after the scheduled event.

The duration of the regulated area is intended to ensure the safety of life and vessels on these navigable waters before, during, and after the scheduled event.

This rule has not been designated a “significant regulatory action,” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>. Accordingly, this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and pursuant to OMB guidance it is exempt from the requirements of <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This regulatory action determination is based on the size, location, duration, and time-of-day of the special local regulation. Vessel traffic will be able to safely navigate through the affected area before and after the scheduled event. Moreover, the Coast Guard will issue Broadcast Notice to Mariners via VHF–FM marine channel 16 about the regulated area and the rule allows vessels to seek permission to enter the area.

The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s605/b">5 U.S.C. 605(b)</ref> that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1–888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734–3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.

In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.

This rule involves the establishment of a special local regulation lasting twenty-three hours over two days extending a limited distance of five miles that will prohibit entry on all navigable waters of the Cumberland River from MM 190.0 to MM 195.0. It is categorically excluded from further review under paragraph 35(a) of Figure 2–1 of the Commandant Instruction and a Record of Environmental Consideration was not necessary.

The temporary deviation provided Multnomah County with additional time to complete necessary bridge repairs. This deviation was authorized under <ref href="/us/cfr/t33/s117.35">33 CFR 117.35</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">While replacing the bridge decking, the bridge owner's construction crew experienced delays with both material deliveries and machining bolt hole tolerances. Therefore, more time was needed to complete the necessary tests and inspections. The subject temporary deviation was approved by mistake in an attempt to give the bridge owner more time to finish construction. After approval of the temporary deviation it was discovered that 180 days would not be enough time to complete construction. After we approved this temporary deviation, we approved a temporary interim rule in order to provide more time to finish the bridge construction. The temporary interim rule effectively replaces the temporary deviation. Therefore, we are cancelling this temporary deviation; docket number USCG–2017–0826 concerning the Morrison Bridge.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The California Department of Transportation has requested a temporary change to the operation of the Tower Drawbridge over the Sacramento River, mile 59.0, at Sacramento, CA. The drawbridge navigation span provides a vertical clearance of 30 feet above Mean High Water in the closed-to-navigation position. The draw operates as required by <ref href="/us/cfr/t33/s117.189/a">33 CFR 117.189(a)</ref>. Navigation on the waterway is commercial and recreational.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The drawspan will be secured in the closed-to-navigation position from 7 a.m. through 10 a.m. on <date date="2017-10-07">October 7, 2017</date>, to allow the community to participate in the Sacramento Century Challenge bicycle race. This temporary deviation has been coordinated with the waterway users. No objections to the proposed temporary deviation were raised. Vessels able to pass through the bridge in the closed position may do so at anytime. In the event of an emergency the draw can open on signal if at least one hour notice is given to the bridge operator. There are no immediate alternate routes for vessels to pass. The Coast Guard will also inform the users of the waterway through our Local and Broadcast Notices to Mariners of the change in operating schedule for the bridge so that vessel operators can arrange their transits to minimize any impact caused by the temporary deviation.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In accordance with <ref href="/us/cfr/t33/s117.35/e">33 CFR 117.35(e)</ref>, the drawbridge must return to its regular operating schedule immediately at the end of the effective period of this temporary deviation. This deviation from the operating regulations is authorized under <ref href="/us/cfr/t33/s117.35">33 CFR 117.35</ref>.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2017-09-15">September 15, 2017</date>, Historic Ships in Baltimore of Baltimore, MD, notified the Coast Guard that from 9 a.m. to noon on <date date="2017-10-26">October 26, 2017</date>, it will be conducting a tow of the historic sloop-of-war USS CONSTELLATION in Baltimore, MD, from its berth at the Inner Harbor to a point on the Patapsco River near the Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine, and its return to its berth at the Inner Harbor.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This rule involves the USS CONSTELLATION “turn-around” cruise, an event that takes place in Baltimore, MD. A permanent safety zone for this rule, with an enforcement period from 2 p.m. through 7 p.m. local time annually on the Thursday before Memorial Day (observed), has been published and is detailed at Title 33 Code of Federal Regulations, section 165.512. However, due to a change in scheduling, the event this year is planned for <date date="2017-10-26">October 26, 2017</date>. If necessary, due to inclement weather, the event will be rescheduled for <date date="2017-10-27">October 27, 2017</date>. The event is scheduled to start at 9 a.m. and the event location remains unchanged.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b">5 U.S.C. 553(b)</ref>). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)</ref>, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule due to the short time period between event planners notifying the Coast Guard of details concerning the event, on <date date="2017-09-15">September 15, 2017</date>, and publication of this safety zone. It is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to publish an NPRM to provide a notice and an opportunity for comment period because we must establish this safety zone by <date date="2017-10-26">October 26, 2017</date> to ensure the safety of vessels and the navigable waters before, during, and after the scheduled event. Such hazards include vessels colliding, sinking or grounding, creating hazards to navigation, and threatening the marine environment.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/d/3">5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)</ref>, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making it effective less than 30 days after publication in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>. Delaying the effective date of this rule would be impracticable and contrary to public interest because immediate action is needed to respond to the potential safety hazards associated with a movement of a historic sloop-of war being towed in confined waters during the boating season in Baltimore, MD.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Coast Guard is issuing this rule under authority in <ref href="/us/usc/t33/s1231">33 U.S.C. 1231</ref>. The COTP has determined that potential hazards associated with the USS CONSTELLATION “turn-around” cruise will be a safety concern for anyone on the Patapsco River, Northwest Harbor and Inner Harbor. The purpose of this rulemaking is to ensure the safety of vessels and the navigable waters in the safety zone before, during, and after the scheduled event.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">IV. Discussion of the Rule
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This rule establishes a safety zone from 8 a.m. through 1 p.m. on <date date="2017-10-26">October 26, 2017</date>, and, if necessary due to inclement weather, from 8 a.m. through 1 p.m. on <date date="2017-10-27">October 27, 2017</date>. The safety zone will include all navigable waters within 200 yards ahead of and 100 yards outboard or aft of the historic sloop-of-war USS CONSTELLATION while operating in the Inner Harbor, the Northwest Harbor or the Patapsco River. This location is entirely within the Area of Responsibility of the COTP Maryland-National Capital Region, as set forth at <ref href="/us/cfr/t33/s3.25">33 CFR 3.25</ref>–15.








 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This rule requires any unauthorized persons in the regulated area at the time this safety zone is in effect to immediately proceed out of the zone. Except for USS CONSTELLATION “turn-around” participants, and vessels at berth, mooring, or at anchor, this rule temporarily requires all vessels in the designated safety zone as defined by this rule to immediately depart the safety zone. Entry into this safety zone is prohibited, unless specifically authorized by the COTP Maryland—National Capital Region. Coast Guard personnel will be present to prevent the movement of unauthorized persons into the zone. Federal, state, and local agencies may assist the Coast Guard in the enforcement of this rule. The COTP Maryland—National Capital Region will issue Broadcast Notices to Mariners to further publicize the safety zone and notify the public of changes in the status of the zone. Such notices will continue until the event is complete. The regulatory text appears at the end of this document.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and Executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on a number of these statutes and Executive orders, and we discuss First Amendment rights of protestors.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits. <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref> directs agencies to control regulatory costs through a budgeting process. This rule has not been designated a “significant regulatory action,” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>. Accordingly, it has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and pursuant to OMB guidance it is exempt from the requirements of <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This regulatory action determination is based on the size, location, duration, and time-of-year of the safety zone. Vessel traffic will be able to safely transit around this safety zone, which will impact a small designated area of the Patapsco River, Northwest Harbor and Inner Harbor for five hours during the weekday when vessel traffic is normally low. Moreover, the Coast Guard will issue a Broadcast Notice to Mariners via VHF–FM marine channel 22A about the zone. Such notifications will be updated as necessary, to keep the maritime community informed of the status of the safety zone.

The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s605/b">5 U.S.C. 605(b)</ref> that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1–888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734–3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.

In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In a letter received by the Coast Guard on <date date="2013-05-16">May 16, 2013</date> NYC DOT and their contractors outlined the first five phases of operations that require in-channel work in the construction and demolition of the Belt Parkway Bridge. On <date date="2013-11-29">November 29, 2013</date>, the Coast Guard published a NPRM titled “Safety Zone; Belt Parkway Bridge Construction, Gerritsen Inlet, Brooklyn, NY” (<ref href="/us/fr/78/71546">78 FR 71546</ref>). There we stated why we issued the NPRM, and invited comments on our proposed regulatory action related to this bridge construction. During the comment period that ended <date date="2013-12-20">December 20, 2013</date>, we received no comments.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2014-05-12">May 12, 2014</date>, the Coast Guard published a TIR and request for comments titled “Safety Zone; Belt Parkway Bridge Construction, Gerritsen Inlet, Brooklyn, NY” (<ref href="/us/fr/79/26848">79 FR 26848</ref>). During the comment period that ended <date date="2014-06-02">June 2, 2014</date>, we received no comments.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2014-07-25">July 25, 2014</date> the Coast Guard published a correcting amendment titled “Safety Zone; Belt Parkway Bridge Construction, Gerritsen Inlet, Brooklyn, NY” (<ref href="/us/fr/79/43255">79 FR 43255</ref>). There we corrected an inadvertent error included in one of the coordinates of the safety zone.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The NYC DOT has requested the USCG safety zone and the USCG bridge permit be extended until <date date="2018-06-30">June 30, 2018</date>, to complete all remaining contract operations in and over the channel, including, but not limited to, substructure concrete placements, steel erection, concrete bridge deck placements, installation of navigation lighting, channel clean up and final fathometric surveying. The Coast Guard is issuing this TIR with an effective date through <date date="2018-12-31">December 31, 2018</date> in case of additional project delays due to unforeseen circumstances.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary interim rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b">5 U.S.C. 553(b)</ref>). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b">5 U.S.C. 553(b)</ref>, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to this rule because it is impracticable as it is necessary to protect the safety of both the construction crew and the waterway users operating in the vicinity of the bridge construction zone. A delay or cancellation of the currently ongoing bridge rehabilitation project in order to accommodate a full notice and comment period would delay necessary operations, result in increased costs, and delay the date when the bridge is expected to reopen for normal operations.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/d/3">5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)</ref>, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>. It would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay promulgating this rule, for the reasons stated above. The Coast Guard will enforce the safety zone described in this rule to all vessel traffic during circumstances that pose an imminent threat to waterway users operating in the area. The Coast Guard will provide as much advanced notice as possible prior to enforcement.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Coast Guard is issuing this rule under authority in <ref href="/us/usc/t33/s1231">33 U.S.C. 1231</ref>. The COTP has determined that potential hazards associated with the construction of the Belt Parkway replacement bridge over Gerritsen Inlet will be a safety concern for anyone within approximately 300 feet of the existing bridge. This rule is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment in the navigable waters within the safety zone during bridge construction.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As noted above, we received no comments on our NPRM published <date date="2013-11-29">November 29, 2013</date> or on our TIR published <date date="2014-05-12">May 12, 2014</date>. There are no changes in the regulatory text of this rule from the proposed rule in the NPRM or in the previous TIR except for the effective period.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This rule establishes a safety zone from 12:01 a.m. on <date date="2017-10-01">October 1, 2017</date> through <date date="2018-12-31">December 31, 2018</date>. The safety zone will cover all navigable waters within approximately 300 feet of the existing Belt Parkway Bridge over Gerritsen Inlet. The duration of the zone is intended to ensure the safety of vessels and these navigable waters during bridge construction. No vessel or person will be permitted to enter the safety zone without obtaining permission from the COTP or a designated representative.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and Executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on a number of these statutes and Executive orders, and we discuss First Amendment rights of protestors.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits. <ref href="/us/eo/13563">Executive Order 13563</ref> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This rule has not been designated a “significant regulatory action,” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>. Accordingly, it has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget, and pursuant to OMB guidance it is exempt from the requirements of <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This regulatory action determination is based on the fact that vessel traffic will only be restricted from this safety zone for limited durations and the safety zone covers only a small portion of the navigable waterway. The Coast Guard will notify the public whenever the safety zone is being enforced and whenever enforcement is suspended through Broadcast Notice to Mariners via VHF–FM marine channel 16, First Coast Guard District Local Notice to Mariners at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.navcen.uscg.gov,</inline> Marine Safety Information Bulletins, or other appropriate means. The rule also allows people to seek permission to enter the zone. Additionally, NYC DOT has a Community Liaison for this project that also communicates with upstream mariners regarding the bridge project and channel status.

The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard received no comments from the Small Business Administration on this rulemaking. The Coast Guard certifies under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s605/b">5 U.S.C. 605(b)</ref> that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1–888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734–3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.

In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.

This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. Under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)</ref>, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule. The Coast Guard was not notified of the need for this rule until <date date="2017-09-13">September 13, 2017</date>. It is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay this action. Waiting for a comment period to run would inhibit the Coast Guards' ability to protect the public and participants from the dangers associated with the high speed boat race scheduled on October 7 and <date date="2017-10-08">October 8, 2017</date>.

The COTP North Carolina has determined that potential hazards associated with the Virginia Outlaw Drag Boat Association End of the Year Showdown scheduled on October 7 and <date date="2017-10-08">October 8, 2017</date>, is a safety concern for mariners during the high speed boat race on the Roanoke River in Plymouth, North Carolina.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This rule establishes a safety zone which will be enforced for portions of the day on October 7 and <date date="2017-10-08">October 8, 2017</date>, on the navigable waters of the Roanoke River in Plymouth, North Carolina. The safety zone will include all navigable waters from approximate positions: Latitude 35°52′25″ N., longitude 076°44′33″ W., then northwest to latitude 35°52′29″ N., longitude 076°44′37″ W., then southwest along the shoreline to latitude 35°52′00″ N., longitude 076°45′31″ W., then south to latitude 35°51′56″ N., longitude 076°45′30″ W., then northeast along the shoreline to the point of origin, on the Roanoke River, Plymouth, North Carolina. This safety zone will be established for the safety of mariners and participants during the high speed boat race. For safety reasons, no public spectators will be allowed to view the event from the waterway. Vessel traffic will be able to pass through the safety zone between race sets with permission. No vessel or person will be permitted to enter the safety zone without obtaining permission from the COTP North Carolina or a designated representative.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">V. Regulatory Analyses
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and Executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on a number of these statutes and executive orders, and we discuss First Amendment rights of protestors.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">A. Regulatory Planning and Review
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net. <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref> directs agencies to control regulatory costs through a budgeting process. This rule has not been designated a “significant regulatory action,” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>. Accordingly, the rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and pursuant to OMB guidance it is exempt from the requirements of <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This regulatory action determination is based on the size, location, and duration of the safety zone. The regulation enforcement period, approximately seven hours per day for two consecutive days, should not overly burden vessel traffic given its short duration. This safety zone will impact a one mile segment of the Roanoke River, Plymouth, NC. Additionally, the rule allows for vessel operators to request permission from the COTP North Carolina or the designated representative to enter and transit through the safety zone. The Coast Guard will issue a Broadcast Notice to Mariners to notify vessels in the region of the establishment of this regulation.

The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s605/b">5 U.S.C. 605(b)</ref> that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">While the precise number of small entities impacted is unknown, the Roanoke River has a low number of vessels transiting the area planned for the safety zone during the enforcement period. Although some owners or operators of vessels intending to transit the safety zone may be small entities, for the reasons stated in section V.A. above, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on any vessel owner or operator.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (<ref href="/us/pl/104/121">Pub. L. 104–121</ref>), we want to assist small entities in understanding this rule.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1–888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734–3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.

In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2017-04-25">April 25, 2017</date>, NAS Jacksonville submitted a marine event application to the Coast Guard for the Blue Angels Air Show that will take place from <date date="2017-11-03">November 3, 2017</date> through <date date="2017-11-05">November 5, 2017</date>. The air show will consist of various flight demonstrations over the St. Johns River in vicinity of NAS Jacksonville. Over the years, there have been unfortunate instances of aircraft mishaps that involve crashing during performances at various air shows around the world. Occasionally, these incidents result in a wide area of scattered debris in the water that can damage property or cause significant injury or death to the public observing the air shows. The Captain of the Port (COTP) Jacksonville has determined that a safety zone is necessary to protect the general public from hazards associated with aerial flight demonstrations. In response, on <date date="2017-08-01">August 1, 2017</date>, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) titled Safety Zone, Blue Angels Air Show; St. Johns River, Jacksonville, FL (<ref href="/us/fr/82/35717">82 FR 35717</ref>). There we stated why we issued the NPRM, and invited comments on our proposed regulatory action related to this air show. During the comment period that ended <date date="2017-08-31">August 31, 2017</date>, we received no comments.

The COTP Jacksonville has determined that potential hazards associated with aerial flight demonstrations will be a safety concern for members of the public observing the event from the water. The purpose of the rule is to ensure the safety of vessels and persons on the navigable waters of the St. Johns River in vicinity of NAS Jacksonville, Florida.

The safety zone will encompass all waters within an area approximately three quarters of a mile parallel to the shoreline, and one mile out into the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, FL. The duration of the zone is intended to ensure the safety of the public and these navigable waters during the aerial flight demonstrations. No vessel or person is permitted to enter the safety zone without obtaining permission from the COTP or a designated representative. The Coast Guard will provide notice of the regulated area by Local Notice to Mariners, Broadcast Notice to Mariners, and on-scene designated representatives.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and Executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on a number of these statutes and Executive orders, and we discuss First Amendment rights of protestors.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">A. Regulatory Planning and Review
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits. <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref> directs agencies to control regulatory costs through a budgeting process. This rule has not been designated a “significant regulatory action,” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>. Accordingly, this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and pursuant to OMB guidance it is exempt from the requirements of <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This regulatory action determination is based on the size, location, duration, and time-of-day of the safety zone. Vessel traffic would be able to safely transit around this safety zone which would impact a small designated area of the St. Johns River for nine hours on each of the three days the air show is occurring. Moreover, the Coast Guard would issue a Broadcast Notice to Mariners via VHF–FM marine channel 16 about the zone, and the rule would allow vessels to seek permission to enter the zone.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s601–612">5 U.S.C. 601–612</ref>, as amended, requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of regulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard received no comments from the Small Business Administration on this rulemaking. The Coast Guard certifies under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s605/b">5 U.S.C. 605(b)</ref> that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">While some owners or operators of vessels intending to transit the safety zone may be small entities, for the reasons stated in section V.A above, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on any vessel owner or operator.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (<ref href="/us/pl/104/121">Pub. L. 104–121</ref>), we want to assist small entities in understanding this rule. If the rule would affect your small business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have questions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please contact the person listed in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-2">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</inline> section.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1–888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734–3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.

In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.

This rule involves a safety zone that would prohibit persons and vessels from transiting through a one square mile regulated area during a three day air show lasting nine hours daily. It is categorically excluded from further review under paragraph 34(g) of Figure 2–1 of the Commandant Instruction.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">EPA is finalizing a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for the chemical substance identified generically as bimodal mixture consisting of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and other classes of carbon nanotubes, which was the subject of premanufacture notice (PMN) P–11–482. This action requires persons who intend to manufacture (defined by statute to include import) or process the chemical substance for a use that is designated as a significant new use by this final rule to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity. The required notification initiates EPA's evaluation of the intended use within the applicable review period. Manufacture and processing for the significant new use is unable to commence until EPA has conducted a <?page num="45991"?>review of the notice, made an appropriate determination on the notice, and take such actions as are required with that determination. The required notification would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before it occurs.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">EPA is finalizing a SNUR for the chemical substance identified generically as bimodal mixture consisting of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and other classes of carbon nanotubes (PMN P–11–482). This final action requires persons who intend to manufacture or process the chemical substance for an activity that is designated as a significant new use by this final rule to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity. In the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> of <date date="2017-06-08">June 8, 2017</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/79/26644">79 FR 26644</ref>) (FRL–9959–37), EPA proposed a SNUR for this chemical substance that was the subject of P–11–482. EPA received no comments to the proposed SNUR and is finalizing the SNUR as proposed. See the proposed SNUR for details and the basis of the proposed SNUR.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">B. What is the Agency's authority for taking this action?
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (<ref href="/us/usc/t15/s2604/a/2">15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)</ref>) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a “significant new use.” EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including the four bulleted TSCA section 5(a)(2) factors listed in Unit III of this document. Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, TSCA section 5(a)(1)(B) requires persons to submit a significant new use notice (SNUN) to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical substance for that use (<ref href="/us/usc/t15/s2604/a/1/B/i">15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(1)(B)(i)</ref>). TSCA furthermore prohibits such manufacturing or processing from commencing until EPA has conducted a review of the notice, made an appropriate determination on the notice, and taken such actions as are required in association with that determination (<ref href="/us/usc/t15/s2604/a/1/B/ii">15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(1)(B)(ii)</ref>). As described in Unit V., the general SNUR provisions are found at <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/p721">40 CFR part 721</ref>, subpart A. Persons who must report are described in § 721.5.

These provisions describe persons subject to the rule, recordkeeping requirements, exemptions to reporting requirements, and applicability of the rule to uses occurring before the effective date of the final rule. Provisions relating to user fees appear at <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/p700">40 CFR part 700</ref>. According to § 721.1(c), persons subject to these SNURs must comply with the same SNUN requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of PMNs under TSCA section 5(a)(1)(A). In particular, these requirements include the information submission requirements of TSCA section 5(b) and 5(d)(1), the exemptions authorized by TSCA section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3), and (h)(5), and the regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/p720">40 CFR part 720</ref>. Once EPA receives a SNUN, EPA must either determine that the significant new use is not likely to present an unreasonable risk of injury or take such regulatory action as is associated with an alternative determination before the manufacture or processing for the significant new use can commence. If EPA determines that the significant new use is not likely to <?page num="45992"?>present an unreasonable risk, EPA is required under TSCA section 5(g) to make public, and submit for publication in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>, a statement of EPA's findings.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">EPA is issuing this SNUR for a specific chemical substance which has undergone premanufacture review because the Agency wants to achieve the following objectives with regard to the significant new uses designated in this rule:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• EPA will receive notice of any person's intent to manufacture or process a TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory (TSCA Inventory) listed chemical substance for the described significant new use before that activity begins.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• EPA will have an opportunity to review and evaluate data submitted in a SNUN before the notice submitter begins manufacturing or processing a listed chemical substance for the described significant new use.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• EPA will be able to either determine that the prospective manufacture or processing is not likely to present an unreasonable risk, or to take necessary regulatory action associated with any other determination, before the described significant new use of the chemical substance occurs.
</p>

Therefore, EPA designated the date of public release/web posting of the proposed rule, as the cutoff date for determining whether the new use is ongoing. Consult the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> Notice of <date date="1990-04-24">April 24, 1990</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/55/17376">55 FR 17376</ref>), (FRL–3658–5) for a more detailed discussion of the cutoff date for ongoing uses. Any person who began commercial manufacture or processing of the chemical substances identified in this rule for any of the significant new uses designated in the proposed SNUR after the date of publication of the proposed SNUR, must stop that activity before the effective date of the final rule. Persons who ceased those activities will have to first comply with all applicable SNUR notification requirements and wait until the notice review period, including any extensions, expires, before engaging in any activities designated as significant new uses. If a person were to meet the conditions of advance compliance under <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s721.45/h">40 CFR 721.45(h)</ref>, the person would be considered to have met the requirements of the final SNUR for those activities.

There is an exception: Development of test data is required where the chemical substance subject to the SNUR is also subject to a rule, order or consent agreement under TSCA section 4 (see TSCA section 5(b)(1)).

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the absence of a TSCA section 4 test rule covering the chemical substance, persons are required only to submit information in their possession or control and to describe any other information known to or reasonably ascertainable by them (see <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s720.50">40 CFR 720.50</ref>). However, upon review of PMNs and SNUNs, the Agency has the authority to require appropriate testing. Descriptions of tests are provided for informational purposes. EPA strongly encourages persons, before performing any testing, to consult with the Agency pertaining to protocol selection. To access the OCSPP test guidelines referenced in this document electronically, please go to <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">http://www.epa.gov/ocspp</inline> and select “Test Methods and Guidelines.” The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) test guidelines are available from the OECD Bookshop at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">http://www.oecdbookshop.org</inline> or SourceOECD at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">http://www.sourceoecd.org.</inline>

These limits cannot be exceeded unless the PMN submitter first submits the results of toxicity tests that would permit a reasoned evaluation of the potential risks posed by these chemical substances. Under recent TSCA section 5(e) consent orders, each PMN submitter is required to submit each study at least 14 weeks (earlier TSCA section 5(e) consent orders required submissions at least 12 weeks) before reaching the specified production limit. Listings of the tests specified in the TSCA section 5(e) consent orders are included in Unit IV. The SNURs contain the same production volume limits as the TSCA section 5(e) consent orders. Exceeding these production limits is defined as a significant new use. Persons who intend to exceed the <?page num="45993"?>production limit must notify the Agency by submitting a SNUN at least 90 days in advance of commencement of non-exempt commercial manufacture or processing.









</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Any request by EPA for the triggered and pended testing described in the Consent Order was made based on EPA's consideration of available screening-level data, if any, as well as other available information on appropriate testing for the PMN substance. Further, any such testing request on the part of EPA that includes testing on vertebrates was made after consideration of available toxicity information, computational toxicology and bioinformatics, and high-throughput screening methods and their prediction models.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The recommended tests specified in Unit IV. of the proposed rule may not be the only means of addressing the potential risks of the chemical substance. However, submitting a SNUN without any test data may increase the likelihood that EPA will take action under TSCA section 5(e), particularly if satisfactory test results have not been obtained from a prior PMN or SNUN submitter. EPA recommends that potential SNUN submitters contact EPA early enough so that they will be able to conduct the appropriate tests.
</p>

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">By statute, SIPs meeting the requirements of sections 110(a)(1) and (2) of the CAA are to be submitted by states within three years after promulgation of a new or revised NAAQS to provide for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the new or revised NAAQS. EPA has historically referred to these SIP submissions made for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of sections 110(a)(1) and 110(a)(2) as “infrastructure SIP” submissions. Sections 110(a)(1) and (2) require states to address basic SIP elements such as requirements for monitoring, basic program requirements, and legal authority that are designed to assure attainment and maintenance of the newly established or revised NAAQS. More specifically, section 110(a)(1) provides the procedural and timing requirements for infrastructure SIPs. Section 110(a)(2) lists specific elements that states must meet for the infrastructure SIP requirements related to a newly established or revised NAAQS. The contents of an infrastructure SIP submission may vary depending upon the data and analytical tools available to the state, as well as the provisions already contained in the state's implementation plan at the time in which the state develops and submits the submission for a new or revised NAAQS.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 110(a)(2)(D) has two components: 110(a)(2)(D)(i) and 110(a)(2)(D)(ii). Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) includes four distinct components, commonly referred to as “prongs,” that must be addressed in infrastructure SIP submissions. The first two prongs, which are codified in section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I), are provisions that prohibit any source or other type of emissions activity in one state from contributing significantly to nonattainment of the NAAQS in another state (prong 1) and from interfering with maintenance of the NAAQS in another state (prong 2). The third and fourth prongs, which are codified in section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II), are provisions that prohibit emissions activity in one state from interfering with measures required to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in another state (prong 3) and from interfering with measures to protect visibility in another state (prong 4). Section 110(a)(2)(D)(ii) requires SIPs <?page num="45996"?>to include provisions ensuring compliance with sections 115 and 126 of the Act, relating to interstate and international pollution abatement.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2010-01-22">January 22, 2010</date>, EPA established a new 1-hour primary NAAQS for NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> at a level of 100 parts per billion, based on a 3-year average of the 98th percentile of the yearly distribution of 1-hour daily maximum concentrations. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/75/6474">75 FR 6474</ref> (February 9, 2010).

NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> is the component of greatest concern and is used as the indicator for the larger group of NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline>.

South Carolina provided the following reasons for its determination: (1) The SIP contains state regulations that directly or indirectly control NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline> emissions; (2) all areas in the United States are designated as unclassifiable/attainment for the 2010 1-hour NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> NAAQS; (3) monitored 1-hour NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> design values in South Carolina and surrounding states (Georgia, North Carolina, and Florida) are below the 2010 standard; and (4) point source emissions of NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline> in the State have trended downward. All other applicable infrastructure SIP requirements for South Carolina for the 2010 1-hour NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> NAAQS have been addressed in separate rulemakings. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/80/14019">80 FR 14019</ref> (March 18, 2015), <ref href="/us/fr/81/56512">81 FR 56512</ref> (August 22, 2016), and <ref href="/us/fr/81/63704">81 FR 63704</ref> (September 16, 2016).

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Ground level ozone is formed when nitrogen oxides (NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline>) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) react in the presence of sunlight. NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline> and VOC are referred to as ozone precursors and are emitted by many types of pollution sources, including motor vehicles, power plants, industrial facilities, and area wide sources, such as consumer products and lawn and garden equipment. Scientific evidence indicates that adverse public health effects occur following exposure to ozone. These effects are more pronounced in children and adults with lung disease. Breathing air containing ozone can reduce lung function and inflame airways, which can increase respiratory symptoms and aggravate asthma or other lung diseases. In response to this scientific evidence, EPA promulgated in 1979 the first ozone NAAQS, the 0.12 part per million (ppm) 1-hour ozone NAAQS. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/44/8202">44 FR 8202</ref> (February 8, 1979). Before the first ozone NAAQS, EPA had previously promulgated a NAAQS for total photochemical oxidants. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/36/8186">36 FR 8186</ref> (April 30, 1971).

This 8-hour ozone NAAQS was determined to be more protective of public health than the previous 1979 1-hour ozone NAAQS. In 2008, EPA revised the 8-hour ozone NAAQS from 0.08 to 0.075 ppm. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/73/16436">73 FR 16436</ref> (March 27, 2008).<ref id="fnd4e5113" idref="fnd4e5119" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref>

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under CAA section 172(c)(3), states are required to submit a comprehensive, accurate, and current account of actual emissions from all sources (point, nonpoint, nonroad, and onroad) in the nonattainment area. CAA section 182(a)(1) and (b) requires that areas designated as nonattainment and classified as moderate submit an inventory of all sources of ozone precursors no later than 2 years after the effective date of designation. EPA's guidance for emissions inventory development calls for actual emissions to be used in the base year inventory. The state must report annual emissions as well as “summer day emissions.” As defined in <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s51.900/v">40 CFR 51.900(v)</ref>, “summer day emissions” means, “an average day's emissions for a typical summer work weekday. The state will select the particular month(s) in summer and the day(s) in the work week to be represented.”

The SIP revision consists of the 2011 base year inventory for the Baltimore, Maryland nonattainment area for the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS. In accordance with EPA's requirements for ozone SIP planning, “Implementation of the 2008 National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone: State Implementation Plan Requirements,” MDE selected 2011 for its base year emissions inventory. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/80/12263">80 FR 12263</ref> (March 6, 2015). MDE's 2011 base year inventory includes emissions estimates covering the general source categories of stationary point, area (nonpoint), quasi-point, nonroad mobile, onroad mobile, and Marine-Air-Rail (M–A–R). In its 2011 base year inventory, MDE reported actual annual emissions and typical summer day emissions for the months of May through September for VOC, NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X,</inline> and carbon monoxide (CO).

Maryland obtained its point source data from the MDE Air and Radiation Management Administration (ARMA) point source emissions inventory.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Quasi-point sources are sources that contain a wide variety of air emission sources, including traditional point sources, on-road mobile sources, off-road mobile sources, and area sources. For these sources, the emissions are totaled under a single point source and referred to as a “quasi-point source.” MDE identified three facilities that met these requirements which include the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Baltimore Washington International Airport, and the Port of Baltimore.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Nonpoint sources, also known as area sources, are sources of pollution that are small and numerous and have not been inventoried as specific point or mobile sources. For example, these sources include residential heating emissions and emissions from consumer solvents. To inventory these sources, they are grouped so that emissions can be estimated collectively using one methodology. MDE calculated nonpoint emissions for the Baltimore, Maryland nonattainment area by multiplying emissions factors specific for each source category with some known indicator of collective activity for each source category, such as population or employment data.

EPA is publishing this rule without prior proposal because EPA views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comment. However, in the “Proposed Rules” section of this issue of the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>, EPA is publishing a separate document that will serve as the proposal to approve the SIP revision if adverse comments are filed. This rule will be effective on <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3"><date date="2017-12-04">December 4, 2017</date></inline> without further notice unless EPA receives adverse comment by <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3"><date date="2017-11-02">November 2, 2017</date>.</inline> If EPA receives adverse comment, EPA will publish a timely withdrawal in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> informing the public that the rule will not take effect. EPA will address all public comments in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting must do so at this time.

This action is intended to preserve the opportunity for General category fishermen to participate in the October through November and December General category fisheries to the extent that transferrable quota is available and is based on consideration of the regulatory determination criteria regarding inseason adjustments and applies to Atlantic tunas General category (commercial) permitted vessels and Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Charter/Headboat category permitted vessels when fishing commercially for BFT.

Section 635.27 subdivides the U.S. BFT quota recommended by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and as implemented by the United States among the various domestic fishing categories, per the allocations established in the 2006 Consolidated Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan (2006 Consolidated HMS FMP) (<ref href="/us/fr/71/58058">71 FR 58058</ref>, <date date="2006-10-02">October 2, 2006</date>), as amended by Amendment 7 to the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP (Amendment 7) (<ref href="/us/fr/79/71510">79 FR 71510</ref>, <date date="2014-12-02">December 2, 2014</date>). NMFS is required under ATCA and the Magnuson-Stevens Act to provide U.S. fishing vessels with a reasonable opportunity to harvest the ICCAT-recommended quota.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The base quota for the General category is 466.7 mt, as established in the 2015 BFT quota final rule (<ref href="/us/fr/80/52198">80 FR 52198</ref>, <date date="2015-08-28">August 28, 2015</date>). See § 635.27(a). Each of the General category time periods (January, June through August, September, October through November, and December) is allocated a “subquota” or portion of the annual General category quota. Although it is called the “January” subquota, the regulations allow the General category fishery under this quota to continue until the subquota is reached or March 31, whichever comes first. The subquotas for each time period are as follows: 24.7 mt for January; 233.3 mt for June through August; 123.7 mt for September; 60.7 mt for October through November; and 24.3 mt for December. Any unused General category quota rolls forward within the fishing year, which coincides with the calendar year, from one time period to the next, and is available for use in subsequent time periods. On <date date="2016-12-19">December 19, 2016</date>, NMFS published an inseason action transferring 16.3 mt of BFT quota from the December 2017 subquota to the <?page num="46001"?>January 2017 subquota period, resulting in a subquota of 41 mt for the January 2017 period and a subquota of 8 mt for the December 2017 period (<ref href="/us/fr/81/91873">81 FR 91873</ref>). For 2017, NMFS also transferred 40 mt from the Reserve to the General category effective March 2, resulting in an adjusted General category quota of 506.7 mt (<ref href="/us/fr/82/12747">82 FR 12747</ref>, <date date="2017-03-07">March 7, 2017</date>). The 2017 General category fishery is open until <date date="2017-12-31">December 31, 2017</date>, or until the General category quota is reached, whichever comes first. Prior to this action, the adjusted Reserve category quota was 156.4 mt, and was most recently adjusted in the action to augment the 2017 BFT Reserve category quota with available underharvest of the 2016 adjusted U.S. BFT quota (<ref href="/us/fr/82/43500">82 FR 43500</ref>, <date date="2017-09-18">September 18, 2017</date>).

Preliminary landings data as of <date date="2017-09-22">September 22, 2017</date>, indicate that the General category has landed 596 mt this year, which exceeds the overall General category quota of 506.7 mt. NMFS closed the General category fishery when the September subquota (123.7 mt) was met, effective <date date="2017-09-17">September 17, 2017</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/82/43711">82 FR 43711</ref>, <date date="2017-09-19">September 19, 2017</date>). Without a quota transfer at this time, the October through November and December General category subquotas would not be available to General category participants because the entire General category quota of 506.7 mt has been reached and exceeded. Approximately 81 percent (717.3 mt) of the total of the BFT subquotas for all commercial categories (888.7 mt, as published in the 2015 BFT quota final rule) has been harvested as of <date date="2017-09-22">September 22, 2017</date>, however, and NMFS anticipates that some amount of quota may remain unused by the end of the year even with the transfer. Absent a transfer at this time, this segment of the fishery would have to remain closed if no adjustment is made, even though NMFS anticipates that commercial-sized BFT will be readily available to vessels fishing under the General category quota when the General category fishery is scheduled to reopen on <date date="2017-10-01">October 1, 2017</date>. Transferring 156.4 mt of BFT quota from the Reserve category would allow this segment of the fishery to continue fishing and would result in a total of 663.1 mt being available to the General category for the 2017 General category fishing season.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Regarding the projected ability of the vessels fishing under the particular category quota (here, the General category) to harvest the additional amount of BFT quota transferred before the end of the fishing year (§ 635.27(a)(8)(iii)), NMFS considered General category landings over the last several years and landings to date this year. Landings are highly variable and depend on access to commercial-sized BFT and fishing conditions, among other factors. A portion of the transferred quota covers overharvests in the category as prosecuted to date, and thus has already been harvested. For the remainder of the transferred quota, which make the remaining subquotas whole to the extent that transferrable quota is available, there is a high probability that the transferred quota will be harvested during the October through November and December time periods.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS also considered the estimated amounts by which quotas for other gear categories of the fishery might be exceeded (§ 635.27(a)(8)(iv)) and the ability to account for all 2017 landings and dead discards. In the last several years, total U.S. BFT landings have been below the total available U.S. quota such that the United States has carried forward the maximum amount of underharvest allowed by ICCAT from one year to the next. NMFS will need to account for 2017 landings and dead discards within the adjusted U.S. quota, consistent with ICCAT recommendations, and NMFS anticipates having sufficient quota to do that.








</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Regarding the usefulness of information obtained from catches in the particular category for biological sampling and monitoring of the status of the stock (§ 635.27(a)(8)(i)), biological samples collected from BFT landed by General category fishermen and provided by BFT dealers continue to provide NMFS with valuable data for ongoing scientific studies of BFT age and growth, migration, and reproductive status. Additional opportunity to land BFT over the longest time-period allowable would support the collection of a broad range of data for these studies and for stock monitoring purposes.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This transfer would be consistent with the current U.S. quota, which was established and analyzed in the 2015 BFT quota final rule, and with objectives of the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and amendments. (§ 635.27(a)(8)(v) and (vi)). Another principal consideration is the objective of providing opportunities to harvest the full annual U.S. BFT quota without exceeding it based on the goals of the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and Amendment 7, including to achieve optimum yield on a continuing basis and to optimize the ability of all permit categories to harvest their full BFT quota allocations (related to § 635.27(a)(8)(x)).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Based on the considerations above, NMFS is transferring all of the available 156.4 mt from the Reserve category to the General category with the objective of making the remaining subquotas whole. Therefore, NMFS adjusts the General category quota to 663.1 mt for the 2017 General category fishing season (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> through <date date="2017-12-31">December 31, 2017</date>, or until the General category quota is reached, whichever comes first), and adjusts the Reserve category quota to 0 mt. If necessary, NMFS will close the General category fishery for October through November and for December when the available subquotas for those time periods are reached.

Dealers are required to submit landing reports within 24 hours of a dealer receiving BFT. Late reporting by dealers compromises NMFS' ability to timely implement actions such as quota and retention limit adjustment, as well as closures, and may result in enforcement actions. General and HMS Charter/Headboat category vessel owners are required to report the catch of all BFT retained or discarded dead within 24 hours of the landing(s) or end of each trip, by accessing <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">hmspermits.noaa.gov</inline> or by using the HMS Catch Reporting App. Depending on the level of fishing effort and catch rates of BFT, NMFS may determine that additional action (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> quota adjustment or closure) is necessary to ensure available subquotas are not exceeded or to enhance scientific data collection from, and fishing opportunities in, all geographic areas.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The regulations implementing the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and amendments provide for inseason retention limit adjustments to respond to the unpredictable nature of BFT availability on the fishing grounds, the migratory nature of this species, and the regional variations in the BFT fishery. Affording prior notice and opportunity for public comment to implement the quota transfer for the remainder of 2017 is impracticable and contrary to the public interest as such a delay would result in continued closure of the General category fishery (because the available quota has been met) and the need to re-open the fishery later in the October through November time period, rather than the fishery automatically re-opening on October 1. The delay would preclude the fishery from harvesting BFT that are available on the fishing grounds and that might otherwise become unavailable during a delay. Therefore, the AA finds good cause under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)</ref> to waive prior notice and the opportunity for public comment. For these reasons, there also is good cause under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/d">5 U.S.C. 553(d)</ref> to waive the 30-day delay in effectiveness.

Recent catch data reported through <date date="2017-09-19">September 19, 2017</date>, indicates that the common pool fishery has already caught 2.4 metric tons, or 65.7 percent, of the Trimester 2 Georges Bank cod Total Allowable Catch since the second trimester began on <date date="2017-09-01">September 1, 2017</date>. We project that, at its current trajectory, the common pool will catch its Trimester 2 TAC well before the end of the second trimester, and is also at risk of exceeding its annual 2017 quota. This possession and trip limit decrease is intended to prevent the common pool fishery from exceeding its allocation for this stock prior to the end of the fishing year.

The current GB cod possession and trip limit for GB cod is 250 pounds per DAS, and up to 500 pounds per trip. Under these possession limits, the common pool fishery caught its Trimester 1 TAC and triggered an area closure for GB cod on <date date="2017-07-27">July 27, 2017</date>. We project that, at its current trajectory, the common pool will catch its Trimester 2 TAC well before the end of the second trimester, and is also at risk of exceeding its annual 2017 quota. In the event that the common pool exceeds its 2017 quota, regulations require that the overage must be deducted from the following year's quota, which would have a negative economic impact on common pool vessels. Therefore, a decrease to the possession and trip limits is being implemented to help prevent the common pool fishery from exceeding its quota for the 2017 fishing year.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, finds good cause pursuant to <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)</ref> and <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/d/3">5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)</ref> to waive prior notice and the opportunity for public comment and the 30-day delayed effectiveness period because it would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The regulations at § 648.86(o) authorize the Regional Administrator to adjust the Northeast multispecies possession and trip limits for common pool vessels in order to help prevent the overharvest or underharvest of the pertinent common pool quotas. The catch data used as the basis for this action only recently became available. The available analysis indicates that the common pool fishery has already achieved 65.7 percent of its second trimester GB cod TAC within the first three weeks of the trimester and if the GB cod possession and trip limits are not reduced immediately, the common pool fishery may exceed its quota for this stock. This action reduces the probability of the common pool fishery exceeding its quota for GB cod. Any overages of the common pool quota for this stock would undermine conservation objectives and trigger the implementation of accountability measures that would have negative economic impacts on the common pool vessels. The time necessary to provide for prior notice and comment, and a 30-day delay in effectiveness, would prevent NMFS from implementing the necessary possession and trip limit adjustment in a timely manner, which could undermine conservation objectives of the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan, and cause negative economic impacts to the common pool fishery.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Coast Guard proposes to establish two special anchorage areas in the Passagassawakeag River in the vicinity of Belfast, Maine. This proposed action is necessary to facilitate safe navigation in that area and provide safe and secure anchorages for vessels less than 20 meters in length. This action is intended to increase the safety of life and property in the Passagassawakeag River in the vicinity of Belfast, improve the safety of anchored vessels, and provide for the overall safe and efficient flow of vessel traffic and commerce. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">II. Background, Purpose, and Legal Basis
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Beginning in the fall of 2008, the Town of Belfast, Maine (ME) Harbor Committee began to discuss the possibility of designating a special anchorage area in the waters off Belfast in the Passagassawakeag River due to the rise of commercial and recreational vessel traffic. Over the next several years the Belfast harbormaster had several discussions with the First Coast Guard District, Waterways Management Division, to understand the processes involved with creating a special anchorage area. In March 2016, the harbormaster submitted a draft proposal to the Belfast City Council and subsequently the town began talks with Coast Guard Sector Northern New England regarding establishment of a special anchorage area in Belfast.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed special anchorage areas are intended to reduce the risk of vessel collisions and to promote safe and efficient travel in the navigable channel of the Passagassawakeag River to the mouth of Belfast Bay clearly defining the mooring fields historically used by the town. All proposed coordinates are North American Datum 1983 (NAD 83).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The rule is intended to reduce the risk of vessel collisions by creating two special anchorage areas in the Passagassawakeag River in the vicinity of the northeastern portion of Belfast, ME. The Coast Guard proposes this rulemaking under the authority established in <ref href="/us/usc/t33/s471">33 U.S.C. 471</ref>, 1221 through 1236, and 2071.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">III. Discussion of Proposed Rule
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed rule would create two special anchorage areas, referred to as special anchorage areas A and B in the Passagassawakeag River in the vicinity of Belfast, ME. Special anchorage area A is approximately 554,800 sq. yards and is on the north side of the river located between the mouth of the Goose River and Patterson Pt, downstream of the US RT 1 Bridge. Special anchorage area B is approximately 693,889 sq. yards and located along the southern shores of the river located between the Belfast Town docks to Belfast City Park.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Vessels less than 20 meters in length, when at anchor in these special anchorage areas, will not be required to sound signals or display anchorage lights or shapes when at anchor. Additionally, mariners using these anchorage areas are encouraged to contact local and state authorities, such as the local harbormaster, to ensure compliance with any additional applicable state and local laws. Such laws may involve, for example, compliance with direction from the local harbormaster when placing or using moorings within the anchorage.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We developed this proposed rule after considering numerous statutes and Executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on a number of these statutes and Executive Orders.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">A. Regulatory Planning and Review
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review) direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). <ref href="/us/eo/13563">Executive Order 13563</ref> emphasizes the importance of quantifying costs and benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and promoting flexibility. <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref> (Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs) directs agencies to reduce regulation and control regulatory costs and provides that “for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process.”
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has not designated this rule a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>. Accordingly, OMB has not reviewed it. As this rule is not a significant regulatory action, this rule is exempt from the requirements of <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref>. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> the OMB Memorandum titled “Interim Guidance Implementing Section 2 of the Executive Order of <date date="2017-01-30">January 30, 2017</date> titled `Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs'” (February 2, 2017).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We anticipate the economic impact of the proposed rule to not be significant. This proposed determination is based on the historic and current use of the area as well as the minimal impact this proposed rule would have on surface navigation. The potential impact would be minimized for the following reasons: 1) normal surface navigation will not be affected as these two areas in the Passagassawakeag River in the vicinity of the northeastern portion of Belfast has been historically used as a mooring field by the Town of Belfast; and 2) this proposed rule would simply permit eligible vessels in existing mooring areas to not to sound signals or exhibit anchor lights or shapes when at anchor there.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s601–612">5 U.S.C. 601–612</ref>, as amended, requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of regulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s605/b">5 U.S.C. 605(b)</ref> that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">While some owners or operators of vessels intending to transit the Passagassawakeag River in Belfast, ME may be small entities, for the reasons stated above in section IV.A, this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on any vessel owner or operator.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">If you think that your business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction qualifies as a small entity and that this rule would have a significant economic impact on it, please submit a comment (see <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-2">ADDRESSES</inline>) explaining why you think it qualifies and how and to what degree this rule would economically affect it.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (<ref href="/us/pl/104/121">Pub.

In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this proposed rule would not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="1988-10-03">October 3, 1988</date>, the Coast Guard published a final rule creating a permanent security zone at Port Canaveral Harbor, Cape Canaveral, <?page num="46008"?>Florida (<ref href="/us/fr/53/38718">53 FR 38718</ref>) to safeguard the waterfront and military assets along the U.S. Navy's Poseidon Wharf inside the southeast portion of Port Canaveral Harbor's Middle Basin. This waterfront area is located on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), a U.S. Air Force military installation. Additionally, the northern and northeast portion of the Middle Basin's waterfront is located almost entirely on CCAFS property, and within this area are piers utilized by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army. CCAFS routinely conducts operations critical to national security.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The U.S. Navy requested to amend the current regulation in <ref href="/us/cfr/t33/s165.705/b">33 CFR 165.705(b)</ref> to expand the geographical boundaries to include the northern and northeastern portion of the Middle Basin of Port Canaveral Harbor in order to ensure the safety and security of military assets and infrastructure along the entire CCAFS waterfront.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The COTP Jacksonville has determined it is necessary to expand the security zone to ensure the security of military assets and waterfront facilities from destruction, loss, or injury from sabotage or other subversive acts, accidents or other causes of a similar nature, while still allowing for safe navigation within the Middle Basin of Port Canaveral Harbor. The proposed expanded geographical boundaries would encompass the entire CCAFS waterfront in the middle basin, with a perpendicular boundary distance from the shore varying from approximately 120 feet to 665 feet. The purpose of the proposed rule is to ensure the security of vessels, facilities, and the surrounding areas within the security zone. The Coast Guard proposes this rulemaking under authority in <ref href="/us/usc/t33/s1231">33 U.S.C. 1231</ref>.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">III. Discussion of Proposed Rule
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Coast Guard proposes to expand the geographical boundaries of the current regulated area in <ref href="/us/cfr/t33/s165.705/b">33 CFR 165.705(b)</ref> to include the navigable waters of the Port Canaveral Harbor's Middle Basin. The proposed amendment would redesignate § 165.705(b) to new § 165.705(a)(2) and would read as follows: “Security Zone B. Middle Basin, Port Canaveral Harbor, at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Brevard County, Florida. All waters within the following coordinates inside the Middle Basin: starting at Point 1 in position 28°24′54.49″ N., 80°36′39.13″ W.; thence south to Point 2 in position 28°24′53.27″ N., 80°36′39.15″ W.; thence east to Point 3 in position 28°24′53.25″ N., 80°36′30.41″ W.; thence south to Point 4 in position 28°24′50.51″ N., 80°36′30.41″ W.; thence southeast to Point 5 in position 28°24′38.15″ N., 80°36′17.18″ W.; thence east to Point 6 in position 28°24′38.16″ N., 80°36′ 14.92″ W.; thence northeast to Point 7 in position 28°24′39.36″ N., 80°36′13.37″ W.; thence following the land based perimeter boundary to the point of origin.”
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed rule would also make the following amendments: (1) Change the title of the existing regulation in <ref href="/us/cfr/t33/s165.705">33 CFR 165.705</ref> from “Port Canaveral Harbor, Cape Canaveral, Florida” to “Security Zones: Port Canaveral Harbor, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL”; (2) add a new paragraph (c) and change the title to “(c) Regulations”; (3) redesignate existing paragraph (d) as new paragraph (c)(1) with minor non-substantive changes; (4) redesignate existing paragraph (c) as new paragraph (c)(2) with minor non-substantive changes; (5) and add a new paragraph (c)(3), which states: “Persons desiring to enter, transit through, anchor in, or remain within the security zone may request permission from the COTP Jacksonville by telephone at 904–714–7557, or a designated representative via VHF–FM radio on channel 16. If authorization is granted, all persons and vessels receiving such authorization must comply with the instructions of the COTP Jacksonville or the designated representative.” Lastly, we propose to add a new paragraph (b), entitled “Definitions” and propose a new definition for the term “designated representative.”

The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s605/b">5 U.S.C. 605(b)</ref> that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">The Challenge of Overweight Parcels
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Overweight parcels should never be accepted for delivery into the postal network. On occasion an item, such as a returns parcel, gets into the Postal network and arrives at a destination plant or post office. It is unsafe to return the item back through the postal network so the receiving office contacts the customer and asks the customer to pick up the package. Sometimes the package is abandoned which creates another safety issue trying to dispose of the overweight item.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Part of the challenge is that we do not want overweight items at any time since these items cause numerous safety issues and we strongly discourage mailers from entering them into the postal system. We do not accept them at postal retail counters either and yet, these items still get into the postal system.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In order to discourage unsafe practices, the Postal Service is seeking input from the mailing community about how to prevent overweight packages from entering the postal system, and if they get into the postal system, the appropriate postage to be paid. The maximum weight for postage payment is 70 pounds.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Suggested Remedies
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">One partial remedy would be to assess additional postage on overweight parcels discovered in the postal network. Thus, if a package weight is 75 pounds, and it arrives at the destination office, with postage calculated at 70 pounds, an additional 5 pounds worth of postage could be collected (70 plus 5). Or if the item is 80 pounds, postage would be collected on the additional 10 pounds. This would appear to provide the Postal Service with at least some degree of reimbursement for the extra service provided.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As a further deterrent, another possibility would be to charge not only additional postage, but an additional penalty fee (perhaps $20.00). Thus, for an 80 pound parcel the total amount due would include the postage payment for 70 pounds, a postage surcharge for the additional 10 pounds and a $20 penalty.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Since HAZMAT parcels have lower maximum weight limits, and overweight HAZMAT parcels may pose additional safety challenges, it would seem appropriate to provide an additional element of deterrence with regard to the mailing of such items. Thus, for example, if a 65-pound HAZMAT package exceeded the maximum weight limit of 25 pounds, the amount due might include not only the postage on the actual weight of the package, but an additional surcharge of $20.00 for each 10 pounds (or fraction thereof) in excess of the applicable weight limit.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We look forward to feedback on this important safety issue.

In the Final Rules section of this issue <?page num="46011"?>of the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>, EPA is approving the State's SIP submittal as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial submittal and anticipates no adverse comments. A more detailed description of the state submittal and EPA's evaluation is included in a technical support document (TSD) prepared in support of this rulemaking action. A copy of the TSD is available, upon request, from the EPA Regional Office listed in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-2">ADDRESSES</inline> section of this document or is also available electronically within the Docket for this rulemaking action. If no adverse comments are received in response to this action, no further activity is contemplated. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As part of DOI's retrospective regulatory review, 2 years ago we developed a schedule for migratory game bird hunting regulations that is more efficient and provides hunting season dates much earlier than was possible under the old process. The new process makes planning easier for the States and all parties interested in migratory bird hunting. Beginning in the summer of 2015, with the development of the 2016–17 hunting seasons, we started promulgating our annual migratory game bird hunting regulations using a new schedule that combines the previously used early- and late-season regulatory processes into a single process. We make decisions for harvest management based on predictions derived from long-term biological information and established harvest strategies and, therefore, can establish migratory bird hunting seasons much earlier than the system we used for many years. Under the new process, we develop proposed hunting season frameworks for a given year in the fall of the prior year. We then finalize those frameworks a few months later, thereby enabling the State agencies to select and publish their season dates in early summer. We provided a detailed overview of the new process in the <date date="2017-08-03">August 3, 2017</date>, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> (<ref href="/us/fr/82/36308">82 FR 36308</ref>). This proposed rule is the second in a series of proposed and final rules for the establishment of the 2018–19 hunting seasons.

AHM is a tool that permits sound resource decisions in the face of uncertain regulatory impacts, as well as providing a mechanism for reducing that uncertainty over time. The current AHM protocol is used to evaluate four alternative regulatory levels based on the population status of mallards and their breeding habitat (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> abundance of ponds). Special hunting restrictions are enacted for certain species, such as canvasbacks, black ducks, scaup, and pintails.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Regarding the Mississippi Flyway Council recommendation to limit regulatory changes to one step per year, we recognize the longstanding interest by the Council to impose a one-step constraint on regulatory changes. We note that the Central and Mississippi Flyways have worked with Service staff during the past 3 years to revisit the AHM protocol for managing harvest of mid-continent mallards. This effort has included a discussion of appropriate management objectives, regulatory packages, and management of non-mallard stocks. These discussions are the appropriate venue to discuss what role, if any, a one-step constraint might play in management of waterfowl in the Central and Mississippi Flyways. Such discussions should include the potential impact of a one-step constraint on the <?page num="46013"?>frequency of when the liberal, moderate, and restrictive packages would be recommended. On a final note, while we recognize the Council's concern about potentially communicating a large regulatory change to hunters, we have concerns about the appropriateness of a one-step constraint in situations when the status of the waterfowl resource may warrant such a measure. We look forward to continued work with the Flyway Councils on this issue.

We note that the current framework opening and closing dates were developed through a cooperative effort between all four Flyway Councils and that framework dates are only one of several components that comprise the regulatory packages utilized in AHM. Regulatory packages also consider season length, daily bag limits, and shooting hours. The current regulatory packages in the Mississippi Flyway should remain unchanged until revisions to the AHM protocols have been completed. Those efforts will include examination of duck harvest management objectives, model updates, and revisions to regulatory packages, including framework dates. We prefer that the issue of framework dates and any other component of the regulatory packages be addressed through this cooperative process and would prefer a comprehensive approach to revising regulatory packages rather than making incremental changes.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Thus, the regulatory alternatives proposed in the <date date="2017-08-03">August 3, 2017</date>, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> (<ref href="/us/fr/82/36308">82 FR 36308</ref>) will be used for the 2018–19 hunting season (see accompanying table at the end of this document for specific information). In 2005, the AHM regulatory alternatives were modified to consist only of the maximum season lengths, framework dates, and bag limits for total ducks and mallards. Restrictions for certain species within these frameworks that are not covered by existing harvest strategies will be addressed in the proposed frameworks rule in early December 2017. For those species with specific harvest strategies (pintails, black ducks, and scaup), those strategies will again be used for the 2018–19 hunting season.

Iowa would choose between an early September duck season or early teal season beginning with the 2018–19 hunting season, and this decision will remain in effect under current frameworks. The Council also recommended that Kentucky and Tennessee be granted operational 4-day teal only seasons when 16-day teal seasons are offered for the 2018–19 season and beyond. If a 9-day teal season is offered, the Council recommends that both States would revert to their original 5-day wood duck and teal seasons. The Kentucky and Tennessee seasons would follow the existing teal harvest strategy.

A review of the available data on mourning dove nesting phenology in the EMU indicated that &lt;1 percent of all mourning dove nest initiations detected occurred in January; thus, the impacts on mourning dove reproduction will be minimal. Furthermore, the maximum additional harvest expected as a result of this action is negligible in relation to the number of mourning doves in the EMU (&lt;0.2 percent of the fall population). Therefore, we do not expect that this action will result in significant impacts to the EMU mourning dove population. However, we also note that nesting phenology may have changed in some areas since the studies cited in the EMU recommendation were conducted and may continue to change in the future. Thus, framework dates later than January 31 should not be considered without new studies that document contemporary nesting phenology throughout the EMU, which would allow assessment of the impact of a later closing date on mourning dove productivity.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Regarding the Central and Mississippi Flyway Councils' recommendation, we supported a change in the opening date to September 14 for the Texas South Dove Zone (<ref href="/us/fr/82/24794">82 FR 24794</ref>, <date date="2017-05-30">May 30, 2017</date>). However, we noted that the National Dove Harvest Strategy used to guide dove harvest management had language that did not allow the earlier date, and would need to be revised. Therefore, we delayed implementation of the earlier opening date until the 2018–19 season. We support the recommendations and the change made to the Harvest Strategy, which will allow the earlier framework date in the Texas South Dove Zone for the 2018–19 season.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS issues a proposed rule that would authorize formation of a recreational quota entity (RQE) that could participate in the Pacific Halibut and Sablefish Individual Fishing Quota Program in International Pacific Halibut Commission Regulatory Areas 2C and 3A in the Gulf of Alaska. The RQE would be authorized to purchase and hold a limited amount of commercial halibut quota share that would yield additional pounds of recreational fishing quota on an annual basis to augment the amount of halibut available for harvest in the charter halibut fishery. The RQE would provide a mechanism for a compensated reallocation of a portion of commercial halibut quota share to the charter halibut fishery. This proposed rule is necessary to promote social and economic flexibility in the charter halibut fishery, and is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982, and other applicable laws.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The harvest of halibut in Alaska occurs in three fisheries—the commercial, sport, and subsistence <?page num="46017"?>fisheries. The commercial halibut fishery is managed under the IFQ Program. The sport fishery includes unguided and guided anglers. Guided anglers are commonly called “charter” anglers because they fish from chartered vessels. Throughout this preamble, the term “charter fishery” is used to refer to the fishery prosecuted by guided anglers. The subsistence fishery provides an opportunity for rural residents and members of an Alaska Native tribe to retain halibut for personal use or customary trade. The following sections of the preamble summarize charter fishery management and aspects of the commercial IFQ fishery that are relevant for the proposed RQE Program.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Charter Halibut Fishery
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Sport fishing activities for halibut in Areas 2C and 3A are subject to different regulations, depending on whether those activities are guided or unguided. Guided sport fishing (charter fishing) for halibut is subject to charter restrictions under Federal regulations that are generally more restrictive than the regulations for unguided anglers. Charter fishery regulations apply if a charter vessel guide is providing assistance, for compensation, to a person who is sport fishing, to take or attempt to take fish during any part of a charter vessel fishing trip. Unguided anglers typically use their own vessels and equipment, or they may rent a vessel and fish with no assistance from a guide.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Over the years, the Council and NMFS have developed specific management programs for the charter fishery to achieve allocation and conservation objectives. The Council and NMFS have developed these management programs with the intent of maintaining stability and economic viability in the charter fishery by establishing: (1) Limits on the number of charter vessel operators; (2) allocations of halibut to the charter fishery that vary with abundance; and (3) a process for determining annual charter angler harvest restrictions to limit charter fishery harvest to the established allocations.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The charter fisheries in Areas 2C and 3A are currently managed under the Charter Halibut Limited Access Program (CHLAP) and the Catch Sharing Plan (CSP). The CHLAP limits the number of operators in the charter fishery, while the CSP establishes annual allocations to the charter and commercial fisheries and describes a process for determining annual management measures to limit charter harvest to the allocations in each management area. The CHLAP and the CSP are summarized below and described in more detail in Section 4.4 of the Analysis.

</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Historic and Current Management Measures for the Charter Fishery
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The CHLAP and CSP were developed in response to increasing harvests in the charter fisheries in Areas 2C and 3A over the past 20 years. Until 2003, charter and unguided anglers were managed under the same two-halibut daily bag limit in all IPHC Regulatory Areas in Alaska. Since 2003, charter management measures have become more restrictive in Areas 2C and 3A, where most charter fishing occurs, as NMFS and the IPHC have sought to limit charter harvests to specific harvest limits. In 2003, NMFS implemented a final rule to establish a guideline harvest level (GHL) that identified target harvest limits for the charter fishery in Areas 2C and 3A (<ref href="/us/fr/68/47256">68 FR 47256</ref>, <date date="2003-08-08">August 8, 2003</date>). After the GHL was implemented, NMFS and the IPHC implemented a variety of additional management measures in Areas 2C and 3A in an effort to constrain charter fishery harvests to the harvest limits established by the GHL. Section 4.4.2.2 of the Analysis describes historical catch limits, regulations, and harvest in the charter fisheries in Areas 2C and 3A.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In Area 2C, charter anglers have only been allowed to harvest a bag limit of one halibut per person, per day since 2009. Implementation of a one-halibut daily bag limit was intended to keep charter fishery harvests to approximately the Area 2C GHL. In the years following implementation of the one-fish bag limit, additional restrictions were required to maintain harvest near the Area 2C GHL, including a prohibition on halibut harvest by charter captains and crew, limits on the maximum number of lines that could be deployed, maximum size limits, and beginning in 2012, a reverse slot limit that allows charter vessel anglers to retain halibut that are either below or above a specific size range. With the implementation of the CSP in 2014, charter fishery management became more restrictive in Area 2C to maintain charter fishery harvests within the Area 2C CSP allocations. In 2017, the charter fishery in Area 2C has a catch limit of 915,000 pounds and is managed under a one-fish daily bag limit with a reverse slot limit that allows retention of a halibut of 44 inches or less, or 80 inches or more, and a prohibition on the harvest of halibut by skippers or crew. Charter management measures for Area 2C are summarized in Table 4–10 of the Analysis.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In Area 3A, a two-fish daily bag limit with no size limits was maintained until the CSP went into effect in 2014. Since 2014, the Area 3A charter fishery has continued to be managed under a two-fish daily bag limit, but management measures have become increasingly restrictive each year to maintain charter fishery harvests within the CSP allocation. In 2017, the charter fishery in Area 3A has a catch limit of 1,890,000 pounds and is managed under a two-fish daily bag limit with a 28-inch maximum size limit on one fish; a 4-fish annual limit for each charter fishery angler; closures to charter fishing on Wednesdays throughout the year; closures to charter fishing during three specific Tuesdays in the summer; a limit of only one charter trip per day per vessel (and per charter halibut permit); and a prohibition on the harvest of halibut by skippers or crew. Charter management measures for Area 3A are summarized in Table 4–11 of the Analysis.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS implemented the CHLAP in January 2010 (<ref href="/us/fr/75/554">75 FR 554</ref>, <date date="2010-01-05">January 5, 2010</date>). The CHLAP established Federal charter halibut permits (CHPs) that are required for operators in the charter halibut fishery in Areas 2C and 3A. NMFS determined the eligibility of applicants and issued CHPs in 2010. CHPs were required for participation in the charter halibut fishery beginning in 2011. NMFS implemented the CHLAP, based on recommendations by the Council, to meet allocation objectives in the charter halibut fishery. Specifically, this program provides stability in the fishery by limiting the number of charter vessels that may participate in Areas 2C and 3A. The CHLAP also issues a limited number of permits to non-profit corporations representing specified rural communities and to U.S. military morale programs for service members.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Since implementation of the CHLAP, all vessel operators in Areas 2C and 3A with charter anglers on board must have an original, valid permit on board during every charter vessel fishing trip on which halibut are caught and retained. CHPs are endorsed for the appropriate IPHC Regulatory Area (Area 2C or Area 3A) and the maximum number of anglers that may catch and retain halibut on a charter vessel fishing trip, ranging from 4 to 38 anglers.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The CSP was implemented by NMFS in January 2014 (<ref href="/us/fr/78/75844">78 FR 75844</ref>, <date date="2013-12-12">December 12, 2013</date>). The CSP replaced the GHL that was in place from 2004 through 2013 for managing the charter fisheries in Areas 2C and 3A. The CSP establishes commercial IFQ and charter fishery allocations that vary proportionally with changing levels of annual halibut abundance and that are intended to balance the differing needs of the commercial IFQ and charter fisheries over a wide range of halibut abundance in Areas 2C and 3A. Under the CSP, the IPHC divides a combined catch limit for Areas 2C and 3A into separate annual catch limits for the commercial IFQ and charter halibut fisheries pursuant to the CSP's allocation formulas.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The CCLs for Areas 2C and 3A are specified by the IPHC during an iterative process that takes place each year. In late November of each year, the IPHC begins the process of assessing the halibut resource, and provides a preliminary estimate of exploitable biomass of halibut. The exploitable biomass is the amount of halibut that could be available for harvest by commercial, sport, and subsistence fisheries. The IPHC determines the exploitable biomass using a combination of harvest data from the commercial, sport, and subsistence fisheries, and information collected during scientific surveys and sampling of halibut bycatch in other fisheries. The IPHC calculates the Total Constant Exploitation Yield (CEY), or the target level for total removals (in net pounds) for each IPHC regulatory area, by multiplying the estimate of exploitable biomass by the harvest rate specified for that IPHC regulatory area. For Areas 2C and 3A, the IPHC subtracts estimates of other removals from the Total CEY. Other removals include unguided sport harvest, subsistence harvest, and bycatch of halibut in non-target commercial fisheries. In Areas 2C and 3A, the remaining CEY, after other removals are subtracted, is the Fishery CEY. For Areas 2C and 3A, the Fishery CEY is equal to the annual combined catch limit for the commercial IFQ fishery and the charter fishery. This process is depicted in Figure 4–1 of the Analysis.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A fixed percentage of the annual CCLs for Area 2C and 3A is allocated to the commercial IFQ and charter fisheries (for additional detail see Figures 4–3 and 4–4 in the Analysis). The fixed percentage allocation to each fishery varies with halibut abundance and differs between Areas 2C and 3A. Overall, the charter fishery's relative share of the CCL is higher when the CCL is lower, but lower when the CCL is higher. At current levels of abundance, the charter fishery is allocated approximately 18 percent of the CCLs for both Areas 2C and 3A, and the commercial IFQ fishery is allocated approximately 82 percent. The IPHC multiplies the CSP allocation percentages for Area 2C and 3A by the annual CCL in that area to calculate the commercial and charter halibut allocations in net pounds. Fishery-specific catch limits are calculated by deducting separate estimates of wastage (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> the mortality of discarded fish) from the commercial IFQ and charter fishery allocations (see Figure 4–1 of the Analysis).

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The CSP also describes a public process by which the Council develops recommendations to the IPHC for charter angler harvest restrictions (annual management measures) that are intended to limit harvest to the annual charter fishery catch limit in Areas 2C and 3A. The process for setting annual management measures is described in more detail in Section 4.4.1.2.2 of the Analysis. Key elements of the process are summarized below.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Each year in October, the Council's Charter Halibut Management Committee (Charter Committee) reviews charter harvest in Areas 2C and 3A during the current year in relation to the charter catch limit. Staff from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Council, and NMFS provide an analysis to predict harvest for the upcoming year under a range of alternative management measures. Some of these measures may directly restrict the number or size of fish that may be retained (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> daily bag limits, trip limits, annual limits, and size limits). Some of these measures may indirectly restrict the number of halibut that may be retained (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> day of week closures, or prohibition on harvest by skipper and crew). After reviewing this analysis, the Charter Committee makes recommendations on possible management measures for Areas 2C and 3A to be analyzed for the coming year.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In December of each year, the Council considers the recommendations of the Charter Committee, the analysis on projected charter harvests under a range of management measures, and any additional information. After considering public input, the Council selects management measures to recommend to the IPHC that are intended to keep charter harvest within the charter fishery allocation in Area 2C and Area 3A under a range of different CCLs that may be established by the IPHC.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">At its annual meeting in January of each year, the IPHC allocates the CCL for Area 2C and Area 3A between the commercial IFQ fishery and the charter fishery for that year based on the CSP regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s300.65">50 CFR 300.65</ref>. The IPHC takes into account Council recommendations, any additional information available to the IPHC, and input from the public and IPHC staff. After considering this information and other information on the abundance of the halibut resource in Areas 2C and 3A, the IPHC adopts CCLs for Areas 2C and 3A and charter halibut management measures designed to keep charter harvest in Area 2C and Area 3A within the catch limits specified under the CSP for the adopted CCLs. Once accepted by the Secretary of State with the concurrence of the Secretary of Commerce, NMFS publishes in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> the charter halibut management measures for each area as part of the IPHC annual management measures.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In 2014, as part of the CSP, NMFS implemented the Guided Angler Fish (GAF) Program to authorize limited annual transfers of commercial halibut IFQ as GAF to qualified CHP holders. The GAF Program provides additional harvest opportunities for charter anglers. Using GAF, qualified CHP holders may offer charter anglers the opportunity to retain halibut up to the limit for unguided anglers when charter management measures limit charter anglers to a more restrictive harvest limit. For example, if charter management regulations in Area 2C restrict charter anglers to a one-halibut daily bag limit, a charter angler could retain one halibut and use one GAF to retain a second halibut, bringing the retained amount to two halibut—the <?page num="46019"?>same daily bag limit that applies to unguided anglers. The GAF Program is described in more detail in Section 4.4.1.2.4 of the Analysis and in the proposed rule for the CSP (<ref href="/us/fr/78/39122">78 FR 39122</ref>, <date date="2013-06-28">June 28, 2013</date>). Regulations implementing the GAF Program are at §§ 300.65, 679.5, 679.41, 679.42, and 679.45. A brief summary of the key elements of the GAF Program is provided below.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In order to receive GAF, an IFQ holder and a CHP holder receiving GAF must submit an application to NMFS for review and approval. Guided Angler Fish transfers may be between separate IFQ and CHP holders, or a person holding both IFQ and a CHP can transfer their IFQ to himself or herself as GAF. Upon approval of the transfer application, NMFS issues a GAF permit to the holder of the CHP. Once the transfer is approved, the GAF permit holder may offer additional GAF harvest opportunities to anglers on board the vessel on which the operator's GAF permit and the assigned CHP are used.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS issues GAF in whole numbers of halibut based on a conversion factor from IFQ pounds. Conversion factors are based on the average net weights of GAF harvested in the applicable IPHC Regulatory Area (Area 2C or 3A) during the previous year. Average weights are determined from data that charter vessel guides report directly to NMFS. For 2017, 74 pounds of IFQ yields one GAF in Area 2C, and 42 pounds of IFQ yields one GAF in Area 3A. Based on self-reported data, CHP holders have paid more than $5 per pound of IFQ transferred as GAF in Area 2C and 3A, making GAF quite expensive, especially in Area 2C (see Section 4.4.2.3 in the Analysis for additional detail). In part due to the high costs of leasing GAF, annual participation has been low, averaging about 48,000 pounds per year from 2014 through 2016.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Three restrictions on GAF transfers were implemented with the GAF Program. First, IFQ holders in Area 2C are limited to transferring up to 1,500 pounds or 10 percent, whichever is greater, of their initially-issued annual halibut IFQ for use as GAF. In Area 3A, IFQ holders may transfer up to 1,500 pounds or 15 percent, whichever is greater, of their initially-issued annual halibut IFQ for use as GAF. Second, no more than 400 GAF will be assigned during one year to a GAF permit assigned to a holder of a CHP that is endorsed for six or fewer anglers. Third, no more than a total of 600 GAF will be assigned during one year to a GAF permit assigned to a holder of a CHP endorsed for more than six anglers. The restrictions on transfers of GAF are intended to prevent a particular individual, corporation, or other entity from acquiring an excessive share of halibut fishing privileges as GAF.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS' costs associated with management, data collection, and enforcement of the GAF Program are recoverable through IFQ Program Cost Recovery fees. The IFQ permit holder is responsible for paying IFQ Program Cost Recovery fees on all pounds of IFQ landed as GAF. The fee calculation is based on the standard price calculated by NMFS, aggregated to IPHC Regulatory Area 2C or 3A.

NMFS initially issued QS to qualified participants beginning in 1994. Once QS was issued, NMFS allows QS to be transferred from initial recipients to individuals meeting specific eligibility requirements. The GAF Program does not authorize the transfer of QS from the commercial IFQ fishery for use in the charter fishery. QS provides individual harvesting privileges that are allocated on an annual basis through the issuance of IFQ permits.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">An annual IFQ permit authorizes the holder to harvest a specified amount of halibut in a designated IPHC Regulatory Area. The specific amount of IFQ (in net pounds) is determined by the number of QS units held, the total number of QS units issued in a specific IPHC Regulatory Area, and the total amount of the halibut catch limit allocated by the IPHC in a particular year. If the abundance of halibut decreases over time, the catch limit will decrease and, subsequently, the number of pounds on a person's annual IFQ permit also will decrease. By providing an exclusive privilege to harvest a certain amount of the catch limit at the beginning of the season, and by extending the season over a longer period, the IFQ Program allows QS holders to determine where and when to fish, how much gear to deploy, and how much overall investment to make in harvesting.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council and NMFS developed the IFQ Program with several goals in mind. Particularly applicable to this proposed action, the IFQ Program was designed to preserve an owner-operated fleet and to limit consolidation of QS ownership. To accomplish these goals, the IFQ Program was designed to control transferability of QS through: (1) Limits on the amount of QS that can be owned or controlled by individuals and companies (QS transfer and use caps); (2) vessel size categories that limit the size of vessels that can use the annual allocations resulting from the QS; (3) restrictions on who can purchase catcher vessel QS; and (4) limitations on leasing certain categories of QS.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Halibut QS is designated as one of four QS categories (also called “vessel categories” or “size categories” of QS). The term “vessel class” is also sometimes used, but the term “category” will be used in this preamble to be consistent with the term used in regulation. These categories include A-category for freezer catcher-processor vessels; B-category for vessels greater than 60 ft length overall (LOA); C-category for vessels 36 ft to 60 ft LOA; and D-category for vessels 35 ft or less LOA. The term “catcher vessel QS” refers to QS that can be used to catch, but cannot be used to process, halibut at sea (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> B-, C-, and D-category QS). Halibut QS also has a designation of “blocked” or “unblocked.” Blocked QS must be sold as a unit, and cannot be separated. No person may hold more than three blocks of halibut QS in any IFQ regulatory area. The purpose of the QS block provision was to ensure that the smallest, most affordable QS would remain available to a part-time fleet of smaller operators in order to maintain some of the fleet diversity that existed prior to the IFQ Program's implementation, and to reduce potential disruption to isolated Alaska fishing communities. The preamble to the proposed rule for the IFQ Program, published on <date date="1992-12-03">December 3, 1992</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/57/57130">57 FR 57130</ref>), describes the IFQ Program in more detail.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">After implementation of the IFQ Program, the total amount of QS held by residents of small, coastal communities and the number of IFQ holders substantially declined. To alleviate the social and economic impacts of this consolidation on rural communities, the Council revised the IFQ Program in 2004 to allow a distinct set of remote coastal communities with few economic <?page num="46020"?>alternatives to purchase and hold catcher vessel QS in Areas 2C, 3A, and 3B (<ref href="/us/fr/69/23681">69 FR 23681</ref>, <date date="2004-04-30">April 30, 2004</date>). This action was implemented in order to help ensure access to and sustain participation in the commercial halibut and sablefish fisheries. Eligible communities can form non-profit corporations called Community Quota Entities (CQEs) to purchase catcher vessel QS. The IFQ resulting from the QS must be leased (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> made available for fishing) to community residents annually.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS determined that CQE eligibility applied to 46 Alaskan communities, based on certain criteria for size, accessibility, and historical participation in the halibut or sablefish fisheries. Eligible communities must establish a non-profit corporation to become a CQE. The non-profit corporation must submit an application to NMFS detailing its organization, structure, and proposed procedures for leasing IFQ to community residents (among other requirements). If NMFS approves the application, a CQE may form to represent that community and the CQE may obtain QS by transfer. Currently, 28 communities have formed non-profit corporations and have applied for and been approved to obtain QS by transfer. Of those 28 CQEs, 4 have purchased QS. Community Quota Entities may also apply to NMFS to be able to participate in the CHLAP by purchasing CHPs, and are authorized to receive Community Charter Halibut Permits which is similar to a CHP, but available only to CQEs. To date, 20 CQEs have applied for and been issued Community Charter Halibut Permits. Although CQE's may also receive CHPs by purchasing (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> transferring) them from non-CQE permit holders, no CQE has received any CHPs by transfer to date.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Although CQEs are subject to different constraints than individual QS holders in the IFQ Program, in some cases, the CQE is subject to the same limitations as individual permit holders in the IFQ Program. For example, each CQE is held to the same QS use caps (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> ownership caps) as an individual holder. In other cases, the CQE is subject to less restrictive measures to provide for the differing purpose and use of the QS when held by communities. For example, the vessel size categories do not apply to QS when held by CQEs. In yet other cases, the CQE is subject to more restrictive measures than individuals, in part to protect existing holders and preserve entry-level opportunities for fishermen residing in fishery-dependent communities that are not are not eligible to form a CQE. For example, CQEs cannot purchase <?GPOnewLine?>D-category halibut QS in Area 2C. In addition, there are caps on the amount of QS that all CQEs combined can purchase, and CQEs cannot lease more than 50,000 pounds of halibut IFQ to an individual resident. A detailed list of provisions specifically applicable to CQEs is provided in Section 4.5.2 of the Analysis.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Purpose and Need for Proposed Rule
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Currently, the charter fishery is limited to harvesting its percentage of the Area 2C or 3A combined catch limit it is allocated under the CSP. Charter catch limits increase or decrease as total halibut abundance increases or decreases. When halibut abundance is relatively low, as it has been in recent years compared to abundance trends in the 1990s and 2000s, the charter allocations under the CSP are lower, resulting in more restrictive annual management measures.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The only way that charter operators can currently provide more opportunity to charter clients than the established management measures allow for in their area is through participation in the GAF Program by individual charter operators. Because of the current restrictions on charter harvests under the existing charter allocations under the CSP and the limited flexibility for charter operators to provide additional harvest opportunities to their clients, the charter fishery has expressed its desire to find a market-based mechanism to increase its overall allocation of the halibut resource.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Based on these concerns, in 2015, the Council initiated the analytic process to develop a “market-based mechanism” to allow a non-profit entity (similar to a CQE) to purchase and hold a limited amount of commercial halibut QS on behalf of charter anglers. The intent of the Council was to provide additional harvest opportunity and less restrictive annual harvest measures for charter anglers in times of low halibut abundance, while complying with total halibut removals under the catch limits established by the IPHC under the CSP. In initiating this effort, the Council sought to balance the objectives of participants in the charter fishery without undermining the goals of the IFQ Program or creating significant adverse impacts to other halibut sectors. A complete history of the development of this proposed action is described in Section 2.2 of the Analysis.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Proposed Recreational Quota Entity for Area 2C and Area 3A
</heading>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Overview
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In December 2016, the Council recommended the implementation of an RQE Program. This proposed RQE Program would provide a mechanism for the charter fishery to compensate the commercial IFQ fishery for halibut QS purchased from the commercial sector to increase the charter annual catch limits. The halibut RFQ that would result from that QS would provide potentially greater harvest opportunities to the clients of charter operators within Areas 2C and 3A.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council and NMFS considered a no-action alternative to maintain the status quo (no RQE Program) and an alternative to authorize an RQE Program. The Council and NMFS also considered a broad range of elements and options to determine: The number of RQEs that could form; the amount and type of QS that could be purchased and held by the RQE; the process for setting annual management measures; how the RQE Program should interact with the GAF and CQE Programs; how the RQE could use funds, the organizational structure of the RQE; and the appropriate reporting requirements for the RQE. The specific elements and options recommended by the Council and proposed by NMFS are described below. The entire suite of elements and options considered, and the predicted effects of those elements and options (including the no-action alternative) are evaluated in detail in the Analysis.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council stated that the principal objective of this proposed rule is to promote social and economic flexibility in the charter fishery by authorizing the development of an entity that would be eligible to purchase and hold commercial halibut QS in Areas 2C and 3A, thereby providing additional harvest opportunities to charter anglers. This proposed rule is intended to promote long-term efficiency in the use of the halibut resource by allowing transfers of QS between commercial QS holders and the charter fishery, through an RQE, under a “willing buyer and willing seller” approach.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Description of Proposed Rule








</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This proposed rule would allow an RQE to be established as an eligible entity to purchase halibut QS in Area 2C and Area 3A, with limitations, for use by the charter fishery as a whole. Using a structure similar to a CQE, the RQE would be an eligible participant in the IFQ Program and could purchase Area 2C and 3A halibut QS for use by all charter halibut anglers in the respective <?page num="46021"?>area. Any halibut QS purchased by the RQE would be held by this entity for the common use of charter halibut anglers. If approved, Federal regulations would be amended to allow the RQE to acquire QS.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Halibut QS held by the RQE would generate annual pounds of recreational fishing quota (RFQ), a type of annual harvest privilege similar to IFQ that would have special requirements that pertain only to the RQE. RFQ would be calculated in the same manner as IFQ. Under this proposed rule, the specific amount of RFQ (in net pounds) would be determined by the number of QS units held by the RQE as of October 1 of the preceding calendar year, the total number of halibut QS units issued in Area 2C or 3A as of January 15 of the year the IFQ or RFQ is issued, and the total amount of halibut allocated to the commercial IFQ fisheries in Areas 2C and 3A for that year.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Although the amount of RFQ would be calculated in the same way as IFQ, it would be subject to different requirements. The additional pounds of RFQ for each regulatory area would be combined with the charter catch limit determined under the CSP to calculate an adjusted charter catch limit for the year for Area 2C or 3A. Annual charter management measures for Areas 2C and 3A would be analyzed, recommended to the IPHC, and adopted for implementation based on the estimated adjusted charter catch limits. Recreational Fishing Quota held by the RQE would be available for harvest by all charter anglers aboard registered charter vessels of any size, regardless of the QS category from which that RFQ originated. Under this proposed rule, RFQ could not be transferred as GAF. Unless specified in this proposed rule, regulations that refer only to IFQ permit holders would not apply to the RQE. Likewise, unless specified in this proposed rule, regulations that refer only to IFQ would not apply to RFQ.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This proposed rule would not change the underlying allocations to the commercial IFQ fishery and charter fishery specified in the CSP, and would not change the total QS pool. Therefore, the QS holders in the commercial IFQ fishery who do not transfer QS to the RQE would receive the same amount of IFQ pounds issued for their QS units regardless of the amount of QS transferred to, and held by, the RQE.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Provisions of Proposed Rule
</heading>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">RQE Organizational Structure
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council recommends and NMFS proposes to allow the establishment of an RQE as a qualified non‐profit entity registered under the laws of the State of Alaska and recognized as exempt from Federal income tax by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to purchase and hold halibut QS for use by the charter fishery. The QS held by an RQE could yield RFQ annually. This proposed rule would allow a single non-profit entity to form to represent and manage separate QS holdings for Areas 2C and 3A.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council and NMFS considered an option to allow formation of two RQEs, one to represent Area 2C and another in Area 3A, but ultimately decided that one RQE would provide administrative efficiencies for purchasing and managing commercial QS. The Council and NMFS initially considered allowing multiple RQEs within Area 2C and 3A, but recommended against that structure to avoid potential competition against each other to purchase QS, and to reduce potential administrative costs.









 
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The structure of the RQE is proposed to be similar to non-profits established to hold QS under the CQE Program. The Council recommended and NMFS proposes that the RQE be a non-profit entity to help ensure it represents the interests of the charter operators, whereas a for-profit entity could result in increased costs. The Council has consistently recommended, and NMFS has consistently approved the use of non-profit entities for the purposes of holding QS in other limited access programs. The proposed RQE organizational structure is consistent with past practice. Also, a non-profit entity that is independent of the Federal or state governments could more quickly and more flexibly take advantage of favorable market conditions for purchasing QS than a program administered by the Federal or state governments. More information on the structure of the proposed RQE is provided in section 4.8.1.1 of the Analysis.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS proposes new definitions in § 679.2 for “Recreational fishing quota (RFQ)” and “Recreational quota entity (RQE).”
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Eligibility
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council recommended establishment of a single RQE that is a qualified non-profit entity registered with the IRS to purchase and hold commercial halibut QS for use by the guided halibut sector.” To implement this recommendation, NMFS proposes requirements specifying that the RQE must be a qualified non-profit entity registered under the laws of the State of Alaska and recognized as exempt from Federal income tax by the IRS. Non-profit status is a state law concept and does not directly apply to Federal tax law. A non-profit organization may be eligible for certain benefits, such as state sales, property and income tax exemptions. Although most Federal tax-exempt organizations are non-profit organizations, being recognized as a non-profit organization at the state level does not automatically grant the organization exemption from Federal income tax. To qualify as exempt from Federal income tax, an organization must seek recognition of exemption from Federal income tax under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This proposed rule would establish specific requirements for an entity to be authorized as the RQE. To be approved as the entity eligible to purchase and hold halibut QS, the applicant wishing to become the RQE would be required to demonstrate it is a non-profit entity registered under the laws of the State of Alaska by submitting to NMFS the articles of incorporation and management organization information, including bylaws and a list of key personnel including, but not limited to, the board of directors, officers, representatives, and managers.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Articles of incorporation are public documents that must be filed with the state agency where the corporation becomes incorporated (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> with Alaska's Division of Corporations, Business, and Professional Licensing). NMFS proposes that the RQE would need to be incorporated within the State of Alaska consistent with incorporation requirements applicable to CQEs. Bylaws are private documents describing the organization's operating procedures that are not filed with any government agency. The Council and NMFS chose to not specify how the board of directors of the RQE should be structured. The Council and NMFS considered options to require a certain number of board members representing different user groups, but ultimately decided that these decisions were best left to the RQE (see Section 4.8.1.6 of the Analysis). The Council intends that the RQE board should have the flexibility to tailor its composition in a way that best addresses the RQE's needs. The Council noted that a representative of the Alaska Department of Revenue may sit as an <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">ex‐officio</inline> (non-voting) member of the RQE board, and the Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, or their designee, may sit as a voting member of the RQE board; however, the Council did not intend be prescriptive with respect to RQE board membership. The Council intended for the RQE to determine whether these officials would be a member of the RQE board. For example, if funding for the RQE is <?page num="46022"?>provided or administered by the State of Alaska, then a board member from the Alaska Department of Revenue might be beneficial; however, the Council intended for this determination to be at the discretion of the RQE. Because the Council intended for the RQE to have flexibility to select members of the RQE board, NMFS does not propose to specify the composition of the RQE board in regulation.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition to demonstrating it is a non-profit corporation recognized by the State of Alaska, the applicant wishing to become the RQE would be required to demonstrate it has been granted an exemption from Federal income tax by the IRS by submitting to NMFS the IRS acknowledgement of the entity's Federal tax exemption.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS proposes to require the approved RQE to maintain its non-profit and tax-exempt status, as described above. If the approved RQE entity does not meet this requirement, NMFS would not issue the RFQ that would otherwise be issued to the RQE based on its QS holdings. In addition, NMFS would provide the approved RQE entity with an opportunity to reinstate its non-profit and/or tax-exempt status. If the approved RQE entity does not demonstrate to NMFS that it is a qualified non‐profit entity registered under the laws of the State of Alaska and recognized as exempt from federal income tax by the IRS by the established deadline, NMFS would issue an Initial Administrative Determination (IAD) to revoke the entity's status as the approved RQE and to require the entity to divest its QS holdings. The entity would have the opportunity to appeal the IAD through the National Appeals Office under the provisions established at <ref href="/us/cfr/t15/p906">15 CFR part 906</ref>. The application and procedures for approving the application to become an RQE would be modeled after the application and process for CQEs. The applicant would complete the “Application for a Non-profit Corporation to be Designated as a Recreational Quota Entity (RQE)” and submit it to NMFS Alaska Region for review and approval. The application form would be available on the NMFS Alaska Region Web site at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://alaskafisheries.noaa.gov/</inline> after the effective date of the final rule, assuming a final rule is published. NMFS would approve the first complete RQE application it receives. NMFS would notify the RQE when its application has been approved. Once approved, NMFS would establish an account for QS and RFQ holdings when the RQE acquires QS. If NMFS disapproves the application, that determination could be appealed to the NOAA Fisheries National Appeals Office under the provisions established at <ref href="/us/cfr/t15/p906">15 CFR part 906</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS proposes adding a new paragraph § 679.41(n) to describe the application process and eligibility requirements for a prospective RQE.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under this proposed RQE Program, two-way transfers of QS would be allowed. Quota share acquired by the RQE could be transferred to an otherwise eligible participant in the commercial IFQ fishery. Because QS and the resulting IFQ used in the commercial IFQ fishery is subject to vessel categories and block designations on initially-issued QS—unlike the QS and resulting RFQ used by the RQE, which is exempt from such categories and designations—NMFS will track QS units, IFQ pounds, and vessel category and block designations that apply to ensure that original categories and designations for the commercial IFQ fishery are maintained during the transfer process.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council recommended and NMFS proposes two-way transfers because it is expected that there would be variability from year to year in the amount of QS the RQE would be interested in using as RFQ. For example, if halibut biomass increases, the RQE may hold QS that is not needed to yield RFQ to provide additional opportunities for participants in the charter fishery, and may decide to sell a portion of its QS to an eligible buyers in the commercial fishery sector.









 
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS proposes modifying § 679.42 to describe the QS transfer process for RQEs.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This proposed rule would establish area-specific annual limits on the amount of halibut QS that can transfer to an RQE. The intended effect of these transfer limits is to limit the amount of halibut QS that could be transferred from the commercial IFQ fishery and used as RFQ in the charter fishery each year, and to minimize any abrupt negative impacts that may occur to participants in the commercial IFQ fishery or to CQEs due to additional competition in the QS market that could occur with the entry of an RQE. Annual transfer limits would allow users in the commercial IFQ and charter fisheries time to adapt business plans and personal strategies to changes in the composition of the fisheries.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council recommended and NMFS proposes an annual transfer limit equivalent to 1 percent of the commercial QS units in Area 2C based on the 2015 pool of all QS categories (59,477,396 units). Based on the 2015 QS pool, the RQE would be limited to receiving by transfer a maximum of 594,774 units of Area 2C QS in a year. Even if the QS pool changes in future years, this proposed rule would fix the annual transfer limit in Area 2C at 594,774 QS units. This will clearly define the limit for fishery participants and prevent a change in the limit if there are future changes in the Area 2C or 3A QS pools. For example, in 2017, the QS:IFQ ratio is 14.1209 QS units per pound of IFQ, and the annual transfer limit would be 42,120 pounds of IFQ for Area 2C.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council recommended and NMFS proposes an annual transfer limit equivalent to 1.2 percent of the commercial QS pool in Area 3A based on the 2015 pool of all QS categories (184,893,008 units). For example, based on the 2015 QS pool, the RQE would be limited to receiving by transfer a maximum of 2,218,716 units of Area 3A QS in a year. Even if the QS pool changes in future years, this proposed rule would fix the annual transfer limit in Area 3A at 2,218,716 QS units. For example, in 2017, the QS:IFQ ratio is 23.8911QS units per pound of IFQ, and the annual transfer limit would be 92,868 pounds of IFQ for Area 3A.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For both Area 2C and 3A, the Council and NMFS considered annual transfer limits between 0.5 and 5 percent and determined that 1 percent for Area 2C and 1.2 percent for Area 3A were the appropriate annual transfer limits because they would allow the RQE to reach the cumulative use limits on QS holding (discussed in the next section) in 10 years if the RQE purchased the maximum amount of QS in each area in each year after the RQE Program is implemented. The Council indicated that limiting annual transfers at these proposed limits and allowing the RQE to reach its maximum QS holdings over as few as 10 years would balance the desire to provide adequate additional harvest opportunity to charter anglers, while at the same time mitigating the potentially disruptive impacts on the QS market with the entry of the RQE. Therefore, the proposed annual limits are equal to 1/10 of the cumulative holdings limits. Annual transfer limits are discussed in further detail in Section 4.8.1.2.2 of the Analysis.

This proportion would be calculated based on the entire QS pool, including categories and blocks of QS units that the RQE would be prohibited from purchasing (discussed in the next sections of this preamble). Ten percent of the 2015 commercial QS pool equates to 5,947,740 units.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This rule proposes a limit on QS holdings for Area 3A of 12 percent of the 2015 entire commercial QS pool, including categories and blocks of QS units that the RQE would be prohibited from purchasing.

The Council recommended and NMFS proposes 10 percent and 12 percent limits in Areas 2C and 3A, respectively, to provide a balance between providing ample opportunity for additional harvest opportunity for the charter fishery, while seeking to alleviate potential adverse impacts to commercial halibut participants from increased competition in the QS market and higher QS prices that could occur if the RQE were provided a higher limit on QS holdings by the RQE. The limits on RQE holdings of QS are discussed in further detail in Section 4.8.1.2.3 of the Analysis.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As part of the RQE Program, the Council recommends and NMFS proposes to limit the total amount of GAF that could be used annually by CHP holders by limiting the amount of GAF that could be transferred to the charter fishery as RQE QS holdings increase.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under existing regulations, a significant amount of GAF could be transferred to CHP holders each year. For example, based on 2015 data, if all QS holders transferred the maximum allowable amounts of IFQ as GAF to eligible CHP holders, 49.1 percent of the Area 2C IFQ and 35.5 percent of the Area 3A could potentially be transferred as GAF. However, actual participation in the GAF Program has been relatively low. From 2014 through 2016, less than 1.25 percent of Area 2C IFQ, and less than 0.2 percent of Area 3A IFQ have been transferred as GAF in any year. Based on the cost to transfer IFQ as GAF noted earlier in this preamble, NMFS considers it very unlikely that participation in the GAF Program will increase substantially and approach the maximum allowable transfer limits. Notwithstanding that unlikelihood, the Council determined and NMFS agrees that limiting the amount of GAF that could be transferred to the charter fishery as RQE QS holdings increase appropriately balances the objective of establishing an RQE to further increase harvest opportunity in the charter fishery while minimizing the negative impacts that may result in the commercial IFQ fishery from transfers of QS.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council recommended and NMFS proposes restricting GAF transfers so that in any year, the combined amount of RFQ and GAF transferred to CHP holders could not exceed a poundage equal to the maximum amount of pounds that could be issued as RFQ in Area 2C or 3A.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The following two examples describe how NMFS would administer this provision in Area 2C. Under this proposed rule, in Area 2C the RQE may hold a maximum of 10 percent of the 2015 Area 2C QS pool (5,947,740 units). These two examples use the 2017 QS:IFQ ratio for Area 2C (14.1209 QS units per pound of IFQ), and the 2017 conversion factor for IFQ to GAF for Area 2C (74 pounds of IFQ to yield one GAF). The first example assumes the RQE held the maximum amount of QS units (5,947,740 units) in Area 2C. Under this example, the RQE would be issued 421,201 pounds of RFQ (5,947,740 QS units/14.1209 QS:IFQ = 421,201 pounds), and NMFS would not approve any transfers of GAF to CHP holders in Area 2C during that calendar year because the combined amount of RFQ and GAF transferred by CHP holders would exceed the cumulative limit for RFQ and GAF in Area 2C (421,201 pounds). The second example assumes the RQE held 50 percent of the RQE's Area 2C cumulative QS limit (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> 2,973,870 units). Under this example, the RQE would be issued 210,601 pounds of RFQ (2,973,870 QS units/14.1209 QS:IFQ = 210,601 pounds), and NMFS could approve GAF transfers to CHP holders equivalent to 210,601 pounds of IFQ, or 2,845 GAF (210,600 pounds/74 pounds of IFQ per GAF = 2,845 GAF) during that calendar year before the combined amount of RFQ and GAF transferred to CHP holders would exceed as the cumulative limit for RFQ and GAF in Area 2C (421,201 pounds). Under this second example, NMFS would approve GAF transfers for CHP holders until 2,845 GAF had been transferred to CHP holders in Area 2C. Once 2,845 GAF had been transferred to CHP holders in Area 2C, NMFS would disapprove all subsequent transfers of GAF in Area 2C for the remainder of the calendar year.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council and NMFS considered options that would not have restricted transfers of GAF even if the RQE reached its cumulative use limit of QS. The Council recommended and NMFS proposes limiting the total amount of annual poundage that could be reallocated to the charter fishery as RFQ and GAF to the cumulative use limit on RQE holdings. This limit was chosen, as described in the previous section of the preamble, to balance the concerns of commercial fishery participants about the increased potential for reallocation to the charter fishery with the interests of charter operators to increase harvest opportunities. The limit on GAF transfers as RQE QS holdings increase is discussed in further detail in Section 4.8.1.2.4 of the Analysis.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council recommended and NMFS proposes limits on the amounts of QS the RQE could hold by vessel category in Areas 2C and 3A. The RQE would be limited to holding an amount equal to 10 percent of D-category QS and an amount equal to 10 percent of B-category QS, based on the 2015 QS pools, in Area 2C. Translated to QS units, this proposed rule would prohibit the RQE from holding more than 889,548 units of D-category QS, and more than 265,524 units of B-category QS in Area 2C (see Table 4–40 of the Analysis).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under this proposed rule, the RQE would be prohibited from purchasing or holding D-category QS in Area 3A. The RQE could purchase any amount, up to the annual transfer and cumulative use limits of A-, B-, and C-category QS in Area 3A.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council and NMFS considered the current composition of the QS pools in Areas 2C and 3A, and the potential impact on specific QS categories when proposing these regulations. D-category QS cannot be fished on vessels greater than 35 ft LOA in Area 3A or 2C. Thus, the proposed limits on the RQE <?page num="46024"?>acquiring D-category shares is intended to maintain vessel size diversity in the commercial fleet. Additionally, the Council and NMFS noted that D-category QS tends to sell for a lower price and could therefore make it a desirable and accessible category of QS for the RQE to purchase (see Section 4.5 of the Analysis). Therefore, the limits are being proposed to reduce the potential for the RQE to obtain so much D-category QS as to impact the size diversity of the commercial IFQ fishery fleet by substantially reducing the amount of QS available for small vessels in the commercial fleet. The proposed limits on D-category QS purchases are also intended to protect the opportunity for new entrants in the commercial fishery because these participants often use vessels that are 35 ft LOA or less.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In Area 2C, B- and C-category QS also provide entry-level opportunities. A total prohibition on acquisition of D-category QS in Area 2C could put market pressure on other parts of the Area 2C QS market that are important for entry and diversity. While C-category QS makes up about 79 percent of the total Area 2C QS pool, B-category QS represents a relatively small percentage (4.5 percent, as shown in Table 4–19 of the Analysis). Therefore, the Council recommended and NMFS proposes limiting RQE QS purchases in Area 2C to 10 percent of the B-category QS pool (based on the 2015 QS pool). Because restrictions on B-category QS transfers would limit the QS market opportunity for the RQE in Area 2C, the Council recommended and NMFS proposes some limited opportunity in the D-category market to relieve some of the potential market pressure on the remaining C-category QS (10 percent of the D-category QS pool in Area 2C). These provisions would ensure that most of the B- and D-category QS are used in the commercial IFQ fishery and are intended to balance entry-level opportunities and fleet diversity in the commercial IFQ fishery, with potential benefits to the charter fishery from transfers of QS to the RQE. The proposed vessel category restrictions are discussed in more detail in Section 4.8.1.2.5 of the Analysis.

The RQE would be prohibited from purchasing blocks of QS by category that equate to 1,500 pounds or less (based on 2015 pounds). For Area 2C, this means that the RQE could not purchase blocked QS of 24,250 units or less. For Area 3A, the RQE would be prohibited from purchasing blocked QS of 35,620 units or less. The Council recommended and NMFS proposes these prohibitions to ensure that small and more affordable blocks of QS remain available for purchase by new entrants and small businesses in the commercial IFQ fishery. The prohibition on the transfer of small blocks of QS will have limited impact on the total available market of QS that the RQE could purchase. Block restrictions are discussed in more detail in Section 4.8.1.3 of the Analysis.

</p>

This estimated combined allocation would be used to recommend the charter fishery management measures for the following year. The process and timeline for setting annual management measures would remain unchanged. Once the IPHC annual management measures are approved, typically in late February or early March, NMFS would issue pounds of RFQ to the RQE based on the number of QS units held by the RQE on October 1 of the previous year to augment the charter catch limit established under the CSP. The Council recommended and NMFS proposes establishing October 1 as the date for determining how many QS units would yield RFQ so that the Council's Charter Committee and the Council would be able to estimate the pounds of RFQ that the RQE would receive in the following year and be able to factor that amount into its recommendations for charter management measures in the following year.








</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The RFQ would not be issued to the RQE in the upcoming fishing year for any QS that the RQE received by transfer after October 1. If the RQE transfers QS that it holds on October 1 to a recipient in the commercial IFQ fishery after that date, NMFS would not issue IFQ to the commercial recipient for that QS in the following calendar year. This approach is similar to the method used in the commercial fishery to allow the transfer of QS but not the IFQ once that IFQ has been used. In this case, NMFS would consider that RFQ is effectively “used” if it is assigned to the charter allocation for the following calendar year. If the RQE receives QS by transfer after October 1, that QS would not result in the issuance of RFQ for the following calendar year. However, if the RQE subsequently transferred any QS received by transfer after October 1 that did not result in RFQ back to the commercial IFQ fishery, NMFS would issue IFQ to the commercial recipient for that QS.

This proposed revision to move the date of record from January 31 to January 15 of each year would ensure that the IPHC would be able to determine the amount of IFQ and RFQ and the total allocations that would be assigned to the commercial IFQ and charter fisheries, respectively, when it adopts annual management measures at its annual meeting in late January.

The current management measure for unguided recreational anglers in both areas is a daily bag limit of two halibut of any size. Under this proposed rule, NMFS would not issue annual RFQ in excess of the adjusted charter catch limit (the sum of the annual guided sport catch limit under the CSP and RFQ from the RQE's QS holdings on October 1 of the previous year) needed for charter anglers to obtain the unguided recreational management measures for that area.
</p>

NMFS notes that the term reallocate is often used in other regulations to describe a permanent transfer of harvest privileges from one group of participants to another. NMFS uses the term redistribute in this proposed rule to clarify for fishery participants and the public that the distribution of excess RFQ to commercial IFQ fishery participants is in effect for one year, and is not a permanent reallocation.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council recommended and NMFS proposes the following process for the temporary redistribution of RFQ (as IFQ) to the commercial IFQ fishery, in the event that the RQE has QS holdings in excess of the amount needed to provide charter anglers with harvest opportunities equal to those for unguided recreational anglers. Each January, the IPHC will recommend charter fishery management measures for Areas 2C and 3A that are expected to limit charter harvest to the adjusted charter catch limit for each area (the sum of the annual guided sport catch limit under the CSP and the estimated amount of RFQ from the RQE's QS holdings on October 1 of the previous year).

If the IPHC has adopted charter fishery management measures that are equivalent to the unguided recreational management measures in either Area 2C or 3A (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> a daily bag limit of two halibut of any size), NMFS would determine the amount of RFQ that would be needed to account for charter harvest in Area 2C and Area 3A under the recommended management measures and issue that amount as RFQ to supplement the charter fishery allocation under the CSP. The difference between the total amount of available RFQ and the amount needed for the charter fishery would be excess RFQ. NMFS would redistribute the amount of excess RFQ using the process recommended by the Council.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under this proposed rule, 50 percent of any RFQ in excess of the amount needed to achieve the unguided recreational management measures in either Area 2C or 3A would be redistributed as IFQ to all catcher vessel QS holders in the applicable area (Area 2C or Area 3A) who held not more than 32,333 QS units in Area 2C, and 47,469 QS units in Area 3A (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> the amount of QS that yielded 2,000 pounds of IFQ in 2015) in the year prior to the redistribution, and who also held that QS eligible for redistribution during the year that the redistribution occurs. This 50 percent would be redistributed among qualified QS holders in proportion to their QS holdings.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council's recommendation stated that 50 percent of excess RFQ should be redistributed “equally” to all qualified QS holders. During Council deliberations, NMFS staff and the Council clarified how NMFS would implement the Council's recommendation. NMFS proposes to implement this provision by dividing the amount of IFQ available for redistribution to qualified QS holders by the total amount of QS units held by all qualified QS holders. For example, if there were 50,000 pounds of excess RFQ to be redistributed as IFQ in Area 3A in calendar year 2025 among QS holders who held not more than 47,469 QS units in the year prior to the redistribution (2024), and in the year during which the redistribution occurs (2025), and the total sum of all QS held by those qualified QS holders was 500,000 units, then each of these qualified QS holders would receive an additional 1/10 of a pound of IFQ in 2025 for each QS unit held. NMFS does not issue IFQ in less than one pound increments, therefore NMFS would round the amount of redistributed IFQ to the nearest pound for each qualified QS holder. Section 4.8.1.3 of the Analysis provides additional information on the method NMFS would use to redistribute excess RFQ.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This proposed rule would require the QS holder to hold the QS in the year prior to the redistribution to meet the clear intent of the Council, as well as in the year that the redistribution occurs in order to ensure the proper administration of this provision. NMFS proposes this requirement to ensure that IFQ is issued to persons who hold the underlying QS eligible to receive the redistribution. If NMFS were to redistribute RFQ as IFQ only to QS holders that held QS in the year prior to the redistribution, it is possible that a person could hold QS in the year prior to the redistribution, subsequently transfer that QS before NMFS issues IFQ for the following year, and receive IFQ from the redistribution even though that person does not hold QS. Issuing IFQ to persons who do not currently hold QS would be contrary to the current functioning of the IFQ Program (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> IFQ is issued to persons who hold QS).








</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under this proposed rule, the remaining 50 percent of RFQ in excess of the amount needed to achieve the unguided sport management measures in either Area 2C or 3A would be redistributed equally among all CQEs that held halibut QS in the applicable area (Area 2C or Area 3A) in the year prior to the redistribution as well as in the year that the redistribution occurs. If no CQE held QS in the applicable area (Area 2C or Area 3A) in the preceding year and in the year that the redistribution occurs, this 50 percent of the excess RFQ would not be redistributed in that area. In other words, the excess RFQ would be unfished or “left in the water” for conservation. The rationale for requiring the CQE to hold QS in the year prior to the redistribution, and in the year the redistribution occurs is the same as the rationale for the redistribution to catcher vessel QS holders described above. NMFS solicits comments from the public on whether excess RFQ should be redistributed to eligible catcher vessel QS holders and CQEs based on this proposed methodology.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Council and NMFS considered options that would not have required a redistribution of RFQ as only IFQ, and alternative methods to redistribute RFQ as IFQ. The Council recommended and NMFS proposes the reallocation procedures in this rule to provide additional harvest opportunity among holders of small amounts of QS as well as to CQEs who hold QS on behalf of coastal community residents. Section 4.8.1.4 of the Analysis describes the options considered by the Council and NMFS and notes that based on the current levels of halibut abundance and the cumulative use limits in Area 2C and 3A, it is unlikely that the RQE could hold an amount of QS that would result in the need for redistribution of excess RFQ.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Magnuson-Stevens Act at section 304(d)(2)(A) requires that cost recovery fees be collected for the costs directly <?page num="46026"?>related to the management, data collection, and enforcement of any limited access privilege programs. This includes programs such as the commercial halibut IFQ Program, under which a dedicated allocation is provided to IFQ permit holders. Fees owed are a percentage, not to exceed 3 percent, of the ex-vessel value of fish landed and debited from IFQ permits. Each year, NMFS sends fee statements to IFQ holders whose annual IFQ was landed; those holders must remit fees by January 31 of the following year. Under this proposed rule, the RQE would be responsible for all cost recovery fees on their annual RFQ.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS calculates IFQ cost recovery fee assessments in November each year. To determine cost recovery fees for IFQ holders, NMFS uses data reported by Registered Buyers to compute annual standard ex-vessel IFQ prices by month and port (or, if confidential, by port group). NMFS publishes these standard prices in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> each year. For example, NMFS published the 2016 standard ex-vessel IFQ prices in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> on <date date="2016-12-13">December 13, 2016</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/81/89990">81 FR 89990</ref>). NMFS uses the standard prices to compute the total annual fishery value of the IFQ fisheries. NMFS determines the fee percentage by dividing management, data collection, and enforcement costs for the IFQ Program by total IFQ fishery value. In recent years, IFQ costs have exceeded 3 percent; therefore, the cost recovery fee percentage has been set at the maximum of 3 percent. Unlike commercial IFQ, which is only subject to cost recovery fees when landed, the RFQ held by the RQE would be considered “used” when issued, because management measures will be based on the combined amount of the RFQ and charter fishery catch limit in each regulatory area.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In years when the RQE holds QS and the RFQ is issued to augment the charter fishery's catch limit, the charter fishery would be effectively using all of this RFQ; therefore, the RQE would pay cost recovery fees on all of its RFQ. Since all annual RFQ issued to the RQE would be considered “used,” NMFS would levy the fee calculated for the RQE's annual RFQ pounds that are issued, rather than estimating RFQ harvest at each point of charter landings. The fee would be calculated using the standard price calculated for Area 2C or 3A and the RFQ held by the RQE. This is similar to the method used to apply an ex-vessel value for GAF. The IFQ cost recovery fee could be levied on the RQE each year the RQE holds QS, and the resulting RFQ is issued to augment the catch limit in the charter fishery. All holdings acquired by the RQE on October 1 of the prior year would be subject to the IFQ cost recovery fee.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For purposes of cost recovery, the RQE would pay fees on all resulting pounds of RFQ, even if the charter fishery's harvest was under its catch limit in Area 2C or 3A for that year. In December of each year, NMFS would (1) determine the standard prices and the cost recovery fee percentage; (2) announce the standard prices and the cost recovery fee percentage in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>; and (3) issue the RQE a fee assessment. The RFQ fee assessment would be based on the number of RFQ pounds added to either the Area 2C or 3A charter catch limit based on QS holdings as of October 1 of the prior year multiplied by the standard price for Area 2C or Area 3A, and multiplied by the cost recovery fee percentage (around 3 percent in recent years). The cost recovery fee payment from the RQE to NMFS would be due by January 31 of each year.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Based on NMFS policy, only “incremental” costs, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> those incurred as a result of IFQ management, are assessable as cost recovery fees. The costs to develop the regulations, accounting, and reporting systems for the RQE Program would be considered incremental and extensions of the IFQ Program and would be recoverable under cost recovery. Agency costs related to development of the RQE Program will be included in the IFQ cost recovery fee assessment. Recently, the costs to administer the IFQ Program has been at or above the 3 percent cost recovery fee limit; therefore, additional costs due to the development of the RQE Program would likely not increase the cost recovery fee percentage for IFQ permit holders. Additional information about assessing cost recovery fees for an RQE is provided in Section 4.8.1.5.1 of the Analysis.

NMFS proposes a similar requirement for the RQE at new paragraph § 679.41(c)(11)(i). If the RQE held QS in the previous year and has not submitted a timely and complete annual report by the January 31 deadline, NMFS would not approve a transfer of QS or issue RFQ until the report is submitted.

The IRFA describes the economic impact this proposed rule, if adopted, would have on small entities. The IRFA describes the action; the reasons why this action is proposed; the objectives and legal basis for this proposed rule; the number and description of directly regulated small entities to which this proposed rule would apply; the recordkeeping, reporting, and other compliance requirements of this proposed rule; and the relevant Federal rules that may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this proposed rule.

The SBA has established a small business size standard for businesses, including their affiliates, whose primary industry is “finfish fishing” (see <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s200.2">50 CFR 200.2</ref>). Commercial halibut QS holders are considered finfish fishers under the RFA. A business primarily involved in finfish fishing (North American Industry Classification Systems code 11411) is classified as a small business if it is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in its field of operation (including its affiliates), and has combined annual gross receipts not in excess of the applicable size standard for all its affiliated operations worldwide. On <date date="2015-12-29">December 29, 2015</date>, NMFS issued a final rule establishing the small business size standard of $11 million in annual gross receipts for all businesses in the commercial fishing industry (<ref href="/us/fr/80/81194">80 FR 81194</ref>). This new size standard applies to all businesses included under the North American Industry Classification Systems code 11411 for purposes of RFA compliance only.

CQEs and the proposed RQE would be considered a small entity, or more specifically, a small organization as defined by the RFA. A small organization is “any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.” In addition, no CQE has more than $11 million in annual gross receipts. The RQE that is proposed under this action would not be expected to have $11 million in annual gross receipts because it does not currently hold halibut QS that would yield $11 million in annual gross receipts. Commercial halibut QS holders would also be considered directly regulated. Most of the QS holders in the halibut IFQ Program are small entities.

NMFS estimates that 812 vessels across all IPHC regulatory areas landed halibut in 2014, the most recent year of complete data on the value of halibut landings by vessel. Of those, 11 vessels would be considered large entities because they showed revenues that exceeded the $11 million threshold.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This proposed action is expected to have distributional impacts to the identified directly regulated small entities. Transfers of QS would be voluntary among all the small, directly regulated entities identified in the IRFA. The preferred alternative is the only alternative considered that would give current halibut QS holders an additional opportunity to transfer their QS and the RQE an opportunity to form and obtain QS. As noted earlier in this preamble, the Council and NMFS considered the status quo and the preferred alternative. However, under the preferred alternative, the Council and NMFS considered a wide range of potential limitations on the amount and type of QS that could be held by the RQE. The wide variation in the options considered under the preferred alternative provided the Council and NMFS with a broad range of potential policy choices to minimize the adverse impacts.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under the preferred alternative, the RQE representing the charter fishery would not be expected to participate in the IFQ Program (and purchase halibut QS) if it did not benefit the charter fishery as a whole. QS holders, including CQEs, would not be expected to engage in a QS transaction with the RQE if it did not benefit from that transfer. However, there is a potential for the RQE to affect the QS market by increasing competition in the market. This increased competition could limit the ability for persons in the commercial IFQ fishery to expand their QS holdings by increasing the market price of QS or limiting the amount of QS available to commercial QS holders and CQEs. This potential negative impact is considered in the Regulatory Impact Review (Section 4.8.2 of the Analysis). To mitigate the expected effects on the QS market, the Council recommended and NMFS proposes provisions to limit the amount and types of QS that could be acquired by the RQE, annually and cumulatively.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Specifically, the Council's preferred alternative (and this proposed rule) would create an annual transfer limitation of 1 percent of the QS in Area 2C and an annual transfer limitation of 1.2 percent of the QS in Area 3A. Cumulative use limits for the charter fishery are proposed to limit the combined amount of commercial QS held by RQE and transferred under GAF (10 percent in Area 2C and 12 percent in Area 3A). Proposed transfer limits include prohibiting the RQE from purchasing D-category QS in Area 3A and limiting it to holding 10 percent of D-category QS in Area 2C, and restricting purchase of B-category QS to no more than 10 percent in Area 2C and 10 percent of B-category QS in Area 2C. Block restrictions would prohibit the RQE from purchasing small blocks of QS. This proposed rule would seek to derive the greatest net benefit for small regulated entities by increasing market opportunities in the charter fishery while ameliorating adverse impacts that could occur for QS holders and CQEs in the commercial IFQ fishery if QS holdings by the RQE were not limited. Overall, the net benefits to directly regulated small entities are expected to be positive.

The RQE would also be subject to cost recovery fees so <?page num="46029"?>it would need to comply with the existing cost recovery fee payment requirements for IFQ permit holders. These recordkeeping and reporting requirements are expected to be administrative in nature.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This proposed rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to review and approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). NMFS has submitted these requirements to OMB for approval under a temporary new information collection, to be merged after approval with OMB Control Number 0648–0272. Public reporting burden is estimated to average per response: 200 hours for Application for a Non-Profit Corporation to be Designated as a Recreational Quota Entity; 2 hours for Application for Transfer of QS To or From an RQE; 40 hours for RQE Annual Report; 1 minute for electronic submission of cost recovery fee; and 30 minutes for non-electronic fee submission for IFQ Permit Holder Fee Submission Form. Public comment is sought regarding: Whether these proposed collections of information are necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information shall have practical utility; the accuracy of the burden statement; ways to enhance quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information, including through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. Send comments on these or any other aspects of the collection of information, to NMFS (see <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-2">ADDRESSES</inline>), and by email to <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">OIRA_Submission@omb.eop.gov</inline> or fax to 202– 395–5806.

If the Regional Administrator determines that the additional documentation does not meet the burden of proving the payment is correct, the Regional Administrator will send the IFQ permit holder or RQE an IAD indicating that the IFQ permit holder or RQE did not meet the burden of proof to change the IFQ fee liability as calculated by the Regional Administrator based upon the IFQ standard ex-vessel value. The IAD will set out the facts and indicate the deficiencies in the documentation submitted by the IFQ permit holder or RQE. An IFQ permit holder or RQE who receives an IAD may appeal the IAD, as described in paragraph (h) of this section.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Cooperative Game Fish Tagging Program was initiated in 1971 as part of a comprehensive research program resulting from passage of <ref href="/us/pl/86/359">Public Law 86–359</ref>, Study of Migratory Game Fish, and other legislative acts under which the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) operates. The Cooperative Tagging Center attempts to determine the migration patterns of, and other biological information for, billfish, tunas, and swordfish. The fish tagging report is provided to the angler with the tags, and he/she fills out the card with the information when a fish is tagged and mails it to NMFS. Information on each species is used by NMFS to determine migratory patterns, distance traveled, stock boundaries, age, and growth. These data are necessary input for developing management criteria by regional fishery management councils, states, and NMFS.

Vessels registered for use with a permit issued under Subparts B through E and Subparts G through I of <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/p665">50 CFR 665</ref>, must display the vessel's official number on both sides of the deckhouse or hull, and on an appropriate weather deck. Vessels fishing for highly migratory species in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) Convention Area must comply with the regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s300.217">50 CFR 300.217</ref>. These regulations require that vessels must display their international radio call sign on both sides of the deckhouse or hull, and on an appropriate weather deck, unless specifically exempted. Regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s300.35">50 CFR 300.35</ref> require that vessels fishing under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty must display their international radio call sign on the hull, the deck, and on the sides of auxiliary equipment such as skiffs and helicopters. The numbers must be a specific size at specified locations. The display of the identifying numbers aids in fishery law enforcement.

In the pelagic longline fisheries, the vessel operator must ensure that the official number of the vessel is affixed to every longline buoy and float. In the coral reef ecosystem fisheries, the vessel number must be affixed to all fish and crab traps. The marking of gear links fishing <?page num="46042"?>or other activity to the vessel, aids law enforcement, and is valuable in actions concerning the damage, loss of gear, and civil proceedings.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Effective <date date="2017-11-01">November 1, 2017</date>, the USPTO will no longer accept cash, including coins, as payment for products and services for which fees are required. This change is being made to streamline the administrative fee collection process and is in accordance with the Department of the Treasury's policy on agencies adopting a no-cash policy. See <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://tfm.fiscal.treasury.gov/v1/bull/17–12.pdf.</inline> There is no requirement that the USPTO accept cash payments. See, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> <ref href="/us/cfr/t37/s1.23">37 CFR 1.23</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The USPTO's total net revenue for the last three fiscal years exceeded $3.0 billion each year, and the cash payment method collections averaged less than $14,000 each year. In fiscal year (FY) 2016, the cash payment method comprised less than $11,000, which represented less than 0.0004 percent of total net revenue collections. Furthermore, the USPTO processed over 4.95 million total fee transactions in FY 2016, and only 55 patent fees totaling under $5,000, and eleven trademark fees totally under $4,000, were paid by cash.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The only other fees collected by cash in FY 2016 were about $1,500 in copying fees. The current self-service copiers are to be discontinued as part of Office plans to enter a “No Cost” contract with a vendor who will keep all payments collected in exchange for providing this service. See <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Setting and Adjusting Patent Fees During Fiscal Year 2017,</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/81/68150">81 FR 68150</ref>, 68168 (Oct. 3, 2016) (proposed rule).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For the past three years, the overwhelming majority of fees have been paid to the USPTO using a payment method other than cash, and the costs of handling, safeguarding, auditing, transporting, and depositing of cash payments greatly outweigh the benefits of continuing to accept the cash payment method.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">While the USPTO will no longer accept the cash payment method on or after <date date="2017-11-01">November 1, 2017</date>, payments will continue to be accepted in-person and by mail when made by check or money order, credit/debit card, or deposit account. Payment of fees attempted with cash will be refused and returned. More information about all accepted payment methods is available at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/fees-and-payment/accepted-payment-methods.</inline>

This helps the Department assess the impact of its information collection requirements and minimize the public's reporting burden. It also helps the public understand the Department's information collection requirements and provide the requested data in the desired format. ED is soliciting comments on the proposed <?page num="46044"?>information collection request (ICR) that is described below. The Department of Education is especially interested in public comment addressing the following issues: (1) Is this collection necessary to the proper functions of the Department; (2) will this information be processed and used in a timely manner; (3) is the estimate of burden accurate; (4) how might the Department enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (5) how might the Department minimize the burden of this collection on the respondents, including through the use of information technology. Please note that written comments received in response to this notice will be considered public records.

RSA and ED will use the information gathered annually to: (a) Comply with reporting requirements under the Education Department General Administration Regulations (EDGAR) <ref href="/us/cfr/t34/p75.118">34 CFR part 75.118</ref>, (b) provide information annually to Congress on activities conducted under this program, and (c) measure performance on the program in accordance with the program indicators identified in the Government Performance Result Act (GPRA). The proposed changes to the existing form will improve user friendliness, clarity of data questions, and accuracy of data reported. Since the ED no longer collects data regarding common measures, the entire section of the report that collects this data is deleted, further reducing burden. These revisions are not significantly different from the original collection, but are proposed to provide clarity, consistency, and usability. In many areas, the data element language has been modified with direct language instead of passive terminology.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), an agency within the Department of Energy (DOE), submitted an extension to an existing Information Collection Request (ICR) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review, comment, and approval, as required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The ICR seeks a 3-year extension for WAPA's Applicant Profile Data form (APD), OMB Control No. 1910–5136. The ICR described below identifies the request, including the anticipated public burden. The ICR is necessary for the proper performance of WAPA's functions. WAPA markets a limited amount of Federal hydropower. Due to the high demand for WAPA's power, WAPA needs the ability to collect information under the ICR in order to evaluate who may receive an allocation of Federal power pursuant to specific marketing plans. This APD public process only determines the information WAPA will collect in its ICR. The actual allocation of Federal power will be conducted through a separate marketing plan process outside the scope of this APD process.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">WAPA is collecting—and will continue to collect—the data under its APD to properly perform its function of marketing a limited amount of Federal hydropower. The information WAPA collects is voluntary. Due to the high demand for WAPA's power and limited amount of available power, WAPA will use the information collected in the APD—and has used the information collected under the current OMB-approved control number—pursuant to its marketing plans, to determine an applicant's eligibility for an allocation of Federal power. As a result, the information WAPA collects under its APD is both necessary and useful.

It is a legal requirement that WAPA must comply with before requesting an interested party submit an application for power. The Paperwork Reduction Act process is not the process in which interested parties apply for a new allocation of Federal power. The allocation of power from WAPA is outside the scope of this process and is completed in a separate marketing plan process by each WAPA region, when required.

As a result, WAPA will allow each region to use subsets of the form, where one region's APD may request less information than another region's APD. Also, to ensure equitable <?page num="46047"?>treatment of applications when issuing a call for applications, WAPA may provide additional directions to clarify certain sections of the APD, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> identify the year or years to use in preparing the APD. Rather than collect unnecessary information, WAPA seeks to collect only the minimal amount of information it needs. To be considered for an allocation of Federal power from WAPA under a marketing plan, the applicant must provide the information requested in the APD. If the requested information is not applicable or is not available, the applicant will note it on the APD. WAPA will request, in writing, additional information from any applicant whose application is deficient. WAPA will notify the applicant when the application is due. In the event an applicant fails to provide sufficient information to allow WAPA to make a determination regarding eligibility by the due date, the application will not be considered.

After submitting the APD, provided the APD is complete and no clarification is required, WAPA does not anticipate requiring any further information for the APD from the applicant, unless the applicant is successful in obtaining a power allocation. The applicant submits only one APD. It does not submit an APD every year. If the applicant receives a power allocation, the applicant will need to complete a regional contract with WAPA to receive a Federal power allocation.

In such case, any recordkeeping of the APD by a respondent is voluntary. For those entities that receive a Federal power allocation, WAPA requires the successful applicant to keep the information for 3 years after WAPA grants the power allocation and the applicant signs its regional contract with WAPA. The 3-year record retention policy will allow WAPA sufficient time to administer the regional contract and to ensure the applicant provided factual information in its application. A 3-year record retention policy will have little impact on most businesses in the electric utility industry. WAPA anticipates that it would take less than 1 hour per successful applicant, per year, for recordkeeping purposes. Within a 3-year period, WAPA anticipates having approximately 30 successful applicants.

This converts to an annual hourly burden of 266.7 hours. An entity will only complete the APD once; it is not required each year. WAPA anticipates that there will be additional cost burdens for recordkeeping of 1 hour per year for each applicant who receives a Federal power allocation. Over the course of 3 years, WAPA anticipates there will be 30 successful applicants. The power may be allocated in year 1, year 2, or year 3. For the purposes of determining the cost burden, WAPA will presume all 30 applicants received an allocation in year 1. As a result, the annual hourly burden for recordkeeping is 30 hours. For the purposes of this cost burden analysis, WAPA is assuming that a utility staff specialist will complete the APD. WAPA estimates a utility staff specialist rate, including administrative overhead, to be approximately $121/hour. For recordkeeping, WAPA estimates an administrative support rate of $60/hour.

Using these estimates, the applicant's cost to complete the APD is a one-time cost per response of $968. In addition to the one-time cost, the applicant will incur an additional expense of 1 hour for recordkeeping per year at the administrative support rate of $60/hour if it successfully receives a power allocation under a marketing plan. The procedure and process for the allocation of power shall be the subject matter of a separate notice and is outside the scope of this process.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The collection uses plain, coherent, and unambiguous language that is understandable to the target audience. The terms in the collection are those used in the electric utility industry. WAPA does not market power to individual members of the public such as homeowners or shopkeepers. Preference entities are statutorily-designated potential customers who generally are involved in the power business. As a result, the language used in the application is understandable to the target audience.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">E. Is the collection consistent with and compatible with the respondent's current reporting and recordkeeping practices to the maximum extent practicable?
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The information collection is voluntary. WAPA will use the information to determine an allocation of Federal power under a marketing plan. As discussed above, there is no mandatory recordkeeping requirement on the applicant if it does not receive an allocation of Federal power. For those entities that receive a Federal power allocation, WAPA requires that they keep the information for 3 years after WAPA grants the power allocation and the applicant signs a Federal power contract. The 3-year record retention policy for such applicants allows WAPA sufficient time to administer the regional contract and to ensure the applicant provided factual information in its application. WAPA anticipates that a 3-year record retention policy will have little impact on most businesses in the power industry who will keep the APD as part of their normal business records. The procedure and process for the allocation of power shall be the subject matter of a separate marketing plan notice and is outside the scope of this process.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">F. Does the collection indicate the retention period for any recordkeeping requirements for the respondent?
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The APD identifies that there is no recordkeeping requirement for the respondent if it does not receive an allocation of Federal power. It also identifies that applicants who receive an allocation of Federal power must retain the records for 3 years.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">G. Does the collection inform the public of the information the public needs to exercise scrutiny concerning the agency need to collect information (the reasons the information is collected, the way it is used, an estimate of the burden, whether the response is voluntary, required to obtain a benefit, or mandatory and a statement that no person is required to respond unless a valid OMB control number is displayed)?
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">WAPA has a limited amount of power available and WAPA's Administrator has discretion in allocating power under a marketing plan. WAPA will (a) use the information collected on the application, (b) not accept incomplete applications, and (c) work with respondents that require assistance in completing the application. No respondent is required to submit any information unless a valid OMB control number is displayed. No respondent is required to submit any information unless they desire a Federal power allocation under a marketing plan.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">H. Is the collection developed by an office that has planned and allocated resources for the efficient and effective management and use of the information collected?
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">WAPA's regional power marketing offices will administer and evaluate the applications. Use and management of the collected information were factored into each office's functions and resource requirements. Historically, WAPA has requested the same relative information from applicants and effectively used WAPA resources to utilize and manage the information in its determinations. Each office will make a recommendation to WAPA's Administrator on which applicant(s) should be awarded a Federal power allocation based upon marketing plan requirements and the information contained in the APD. WAPA's Administrator has discretion in the final award of power allocations. The procedure and process for the allocation of power shall be the subject matter of a separate marketing plan notice and is outside the scope of this process.

The submissions also may contain internal confidential information that constitutes trade secrets and commercial/financial information that the respondent does not routinely make public and public release of the submitted information could cause competitive harm by revealing information about the types and deployment of cable equipment and the traffic that flows across the system. For these reasons, the information requested in (b) (Terrestrial Route Map) and (c) (Undersea Location Spreadsheet) above is presumptively exempt from public disclosure under Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Exemption 3, <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s552/b/3">5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3)</ref>, and section 4(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, <ref href="/us/usc/t47/s154/j">47 U.S.C. 154(j)</ref>, as implemented in <ref href="/us/cfr/t47/s0.457/c/1/i">47 CFR 0.457(c)(1)(i)</ref> (exempting disclosure of “maps showing the exact location of submarine cables”). The information requested in (a) (System Status and Restoration Messages) and (d) (Restoration Capability) described above will be considered exempt under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s552/b/4">5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)</ref>. If a FOIA request is filed for information submitted in response to this request, the respondent whose records are the subject of the request will be notified of the FOIA request and given the opportunity to oppose release of the records. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> <ref href="/us/cfr/t47/s0.461/d/3">47 CFR 0.461(d)(3)</ref>.

</p>
                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Background and Brief Description
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In 2012, HHS/CDC launched Phase 1 of the National Tobacco Prevention and Control Public Education Campaign (The Campaign). The primary objectives of The Campaign are to encourage smokers to quit smoking and to encourage nonsmokers to communicate with smokers about the dangers of smoking. To evaluate “The Campaign,” CDC obtained OMB approval for information collections beginning in 2012 (OMB Control Number 0920–0923). CDC conducted baseline and follow-up surveys with both smokers and nonsmokers.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In 2013, CDC launched Phase 2 of “The Campaign” and conducted an additional survey with smokers and one additional survey with nonsmokers under OMB Control Number 0920–0923.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">CDC recently completed collecting the information needed to evaluate Phase 3 of “The Campaign,” which launched in early 2014. The evaluation of The Campaign in 2014 consisted of a longitudinal cohort using four waves of online surveys involving smokers and three waves involving nonsmokers to assess their awareness of and reactions to the 2014 advertisements as related to The Campaign's objectives (see previously-approved information collection with OMB Control Number 0920–0923, expired 3/31/2017).
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The final wave of this data collection effort also served as a pre-campaign baseline for Phase 4 of the campaign in 2015. The CDC subsequently aired Phase 5 of the campaign in 2016. To evaluate Phases 4 and 5, CDC fielded four additional waves of survey data collection. CDC fielded these data collections from September to November in 2015 and March to June, June to August, and November to December of 2016 (see previously approved information collection under OMB Control Number 0920–1083, expires 9/30/2017).
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">CDC has scheduled to launch new media activities for Phases 6 and 7 of “The Campaign” in early 2017 and early 2018, respectively. To support evaluation of “The Campaign” through Phases 6 and 7, CDC plans to field five new waves of information collection. CDC will field the surveys in English and Spanish and will occur during 2017 and 2018. Once enrolled in the first wave of data collection, researchers will re-contact all participants for follow-up at subsequent survey waves.








 </p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The sample for the data collection will originate from two sources: (1) An online longitudinal cohort of smokers and nonsmokers, sampled randomly from postal mailing addresses in the United States (address-based sample, or ABS); and (2) the existing GfK KnowledgePanel, an established long-term online panel of U.S. adults. The ABS-sourced longitudinal cohort will consist of smokers and nonsmokers who have not previously participated in any established online panels to reduce potential panel conditioning bias from previous participation. GfK will recruit the new cohort, utilizing similar recruitment methods that are used in the recruitment of KnowledgePanel. To support larger sample sizes that will allow for more in-depth subgroup analysis, which is a key objective for CDC, researchers will use the GfK KnowledgePanel in combination with the new ABS-sourced cohort. Researchers will conduct all online surveys, regardless of sample source, via the GfK KnowledgePanel Web portal for self-administered surveys.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Researchers will collect information through Web surveys (self-administered on computers in the respondent's home or in another convenient location). Researchers will collect information about smokers' and nonsmokers' awareness of and exposure to specific campaign advertisements; knowledge, attitudes, beliefs related to smoking and secondhand smoke; and other marketing exposure. The surveys will also measure behaviors related to smoking cessation (among the smokers in the sample) and behaviors related to nonsmokers' encouragement of smokers to quit smoking, recommendations of cessation services, and attitudes about other tobacco and nicotine products.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">It is important to evaluate “The Campaign” in a context that assesses the dynamic nature of tobacco product marketing and uptake of various tobacco products, particularly since these may affect successful cessation rates. Survey instruments may be updated to include new or revised items on relevant topics, including cigars, noncombustible tobacco products, and other emerging trends in tobacco use.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Participation is voluntary and there are no costs to respondents other than their time. CDC estimates the total response burden at 37,170 hours over two years between August 2017 and February 2019. Thus, CDC estimates the total annualized burden hours at 18,585 for the combined English and Spanish versions of each survey.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has submitted the information collection request titled National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. CDC previously published a “Proposed Data Collection Submitted for Public Comment and Recommendations” notice on <date date="2017-01-17">January 17, 2017</date> to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies. CDC did not receive comments related to the previous notice. This notice serves to allow an additional 30 days for public and affected agency comments.

                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Background and Brief Description
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Underground coal mining in the U.S. is a relatively small industry (about 46,000 employees) that operates in a unique and hazardous work environment. The common presence of explosive gasses and other hazards creates special safety requirements for equipment, including safety and health protection technologies, used in underground coal mines.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The MINER Act of 2006 assigned the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) the responsibility to enhance development of new mine safety and health protection technology and technological applications and to expedite the commercial availability and implementation of such technology. As part of this study, NIOSH seeks to identify the barriers to commercial availability and implementation of such technology in U.S. mines.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Experience to date has shown that there are many issues that the U.S. <?page num="46061"?>mining industry faces that create barriers to the availability and implementation of safety technologies, and we believe there are other more subtle reasons that we do not fully understand as a Government research agency. The data will help provide insight into what the most important barriers are from the perspective of the organizations that must purchase, use, approve, and manufacture these safety technologies.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NIOSH has an understanding of some of these barriers, however, NIOSH is not an end user of these products. Thus, the goal of the study is to provide a complete perspective of the barriers from the point of view of the mine operators and technology innovators, in order to improve the efficacy of the contract and grant awards that NIOSH administers under the authority of the MINER Act.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Federal Mine Safety &amp; Health Act of 1977, Section 501 authorizes the collection of this data. A CDC contractor will collect the required data.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NIOSH will identify 200 stakeholder organizations for structured interviews and a workshop. Stakeholder organizations include those parties involved in the development, supply, use, and regulation of safety and health protection technologies relevant to underground coal mining. Because there is no nationally representative database of these stakeholder organizations, NIOSH will use web searches of supplier and mining company Web sites, online mining publications, trade association member directories, federal and state regulator Web sites, and university mining research and development programs to compile a list of 200 organizations. Representatives of NIOSH Office of Mining Safety and Health Research will also augment the search with their input.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">From the 200 stakeholder organizations, 150 representatives will participate in structured interviews. CDC expects that a pre-call to each organization will require 15 minutes to complete and the structured interview will require 60 minutes to complete, including the time it may take respondents to look-up and retrieve needed information.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, 30 stakeholder representatives will participate in the workshop. The burden table below reflects 15 hours of burden for each workshop group. This includes the in-person participation of 9 hours and 6 hours of travel time. A total of 10 respondents per year will participate in the workshop. The estimated annualized burden hours for the respondents' time to participate in this information collection are 217 hours.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">CDC seeks a three-year OMB approval to collect information.

</p>
                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Background and Brief Description
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">HIV infections remain high among young men who have sex with men. The estimated number of new HIV infections increased between 2008 and 2010 both overall and among MSM ages 13 to 24. Sexual risk behaviors associated with HIV, other sexually transmitted disease (STD), and pregnancy often emerge in adolescence. The 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) data revealed 41.2% of U.S. high school students reported having had sex, and among those who had sex in the previous three months, only 56.9% reported having used a condom during last sexual intercourse. The data revealed high school students identifying as gay, lesbian, and bisexual and those reporting sexual contact with both males and females were more likely to engage in sexual risk-taking behaviors than heterosexual students.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Given the disproportionate risk for HIV among YMSM ages 13–24, it is important to find ways to reach the younger youth (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> ages 13–19) in this range to decrease sexual risk behaviors and increase health-promoting behaviors such as routine HIV testing. Schools provide one opportunity for this. Because schools enroll more than 22 million teens (ages 14–19) and often have existing health and social services infrastructure, schools and their staff members are well-positioned to connect youth to a wide range of needed services, including housing assistance, support groups, and sexual health services such as HIV testing. As a result, CDC's DASH has focused a number of HIV and STD prevention efforts on strategies that can be implemented in or centered around schools.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For this revised information collection project, CDC requests a one-year OMB approval. This CDC-funded information collection project is the third data collection to assess HIV and STD prevention efforts in one local education agency (LEA). CDC's cooperative agreement, under funding opportunity announcement PS13–1308: <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Promoting Adolescent Health through School-Based HIV/STD Prevention and School-Based Surveillance,</inline> funds agencies and organizations to implement the following four key strategies. Strategy 1: School-Based Surveillance; Strategy 2: School-Based HIV/STD Prevention; Strategy 3: Capacity Building Assistance for School-Based HIV/STD Prevention; and Strategy 4: School-Centered HIV/STD Prevention for Young Men Who Have Sex with Men. This project aligns with Strategy 4 implementation.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This collection will provide data and reports for the LEA, and will allow the LEA to identify program areas that are working well and other areas that need improvement. The findings will allow CDC to determine the potential impact of currently recommended strategies and make changes to those recommendations if necessary.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The questionnaire covers demographics, HIV/STD risk behaviors, use of HIV/health services, experiences at school, including school connectedness, harassment and bullying, homophobia, support of LGBTQ students, sexual orientation, receipt of referral for HIV and STD prevention health services, and health education.







 </p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This data collection system involves administration of a paper-and-pencil questionnaire to seven high schools that are participating in the HIV/STD prevention project. This is the third and final data collection of a 4-year project that includes three data collections; previous data collections occurred in December 2014 and December 2016. Data collection points coincide with the approximate beginning, mid-way, and end points of the cooperative agreement.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We anticipate the final data collection will yield data from up to 16,500 high school students in grades 9 through 12 at the selected schools. Although some students may have completed the questionnaire in one or more of the previous years, this is not a longitudinal design and researchers will not track individual student responses across the years. Researchers will not collect personally identifiable information.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">All students' parents will receive parental consent forms to provide them with an opportunity to opt their children out of the study. Each student will read verbal assent language that explains that he or she may choose not to complete the questionnaire or may skip any questions without penalty. Participation is voluntary.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The estimated burden per response ranges from 35–45 minutes due to the variability in skip patterns that may occur. Students will complete the questionnaire only once under this approval. Annualizing the collection over a one-year period results in an estimated annualized burden of 11,000 hours for respondents. There are no costs to respondents other than their time.

The November submission introduces a new fiscal year to the budget cycle and serves as the basis for the formulation of the Medicaid portion of the President's Budget, which is presented to Congress in January. The February and August submissions are used primarily for budget execution in providing interim updates to our Office of Financial Management, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Office of Management and Budget, and Congress depending on the scheduling of the national budget review process in a given fiscal year. The submissions provide us with base information necessary to track current year obligations and expenditures in relation to the current year appropriation and to notify senior managers of any impending surpluses or deficits.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Evidence-Based Falls Prevention Programs support a national resource center and award competitive grants to implement evidence-based community programs that have been proven to reduce the incidence of falls for older adults and adults with disabilities (including Tribal elders). The programs also identify sustainable funding mechanisms for these programs via the resource center, promote the importance of falls prevention strategies, and provide public education about the risks of falls and ways to prevent them.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">OMB approval of the existing set of Falls Prevention data collection tools (OMB Control Number, 0985–0039) expires on <date date="2018-01-31">01/31/2018</date>. This data collection continues to be necessary for monitoring program operations and outcomes. ACL/AoA proposes to use the following tools: (1) Semi-annual performance reports to monitor grantee progress; (2) a Host Organization Data form to record location of agencies that sponsor programs that will allow mapping of the delivery infrastructure; and (3) a set of tools used to collect information at each program completed by the program leaders (Program Information Cover Sheet and Attendance Log), a Participant Information Form completed by each participant, and a Post Program Survey to be completed by a random sample of participants. ACL/AoA intends to continue using an online data entry system for the program and participant survey data. In addition to non-substantive formatting edits, minor changes are being proposed to 2 of the 5 currently approved tools, as indicated below. All changes proposed are based on feedback from a focus group that included a sub-set of current grantees and consultation with subject-matter experts.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The conventional approach to establish bioequivalence (BE) for most topical dermatological generic drug products relies upon clinical endpoint BE studies. The risk of failing to demonstrate BE due to the relative insensitivity of these clinical endpoint studies, combined with their burden and length, may represent a barrier to generic drug development and may adversely impact patient access to some topical dermatological generic drug products. FDA is evaluating alternative BE approaches for topical dermatological generic drug products, using methods that are more efficient, and also more sensitive and reproducible. FDA believes that these BE approaches would benefit from public discussion.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This public workshop will focus on a discussion of current regulatory science initiatives intended to foster the development of topical dermatological generic drug products, examining alternative BE approaches that may be more efficient and less risky than traditional approaches. FDA is also interested in receiving public input about any barriers that may limit the use of such alternative BE approaches in the development of topical dermatological generic drug products. Public input is also sought about strategies to overcome these barriers.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FDA is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled “ANDA Submissions—Amendments to Abbreviated New Drug Applications Under GDUFA.” This guidance is intended to assist applicants preparing to submit amendments to ANDAs or PASs to FDA under section 505(j) of the FD&amp;C Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t21/s355/j">21 U.S.C. 355(j)</ref>) by explaining how the review goals established as part of GDUFA II apply to these submissions. In accordance with the “GDUFA Reauthorization Performance Goals and Program Enhancements Fiscal Years 2018–2022” (GDUFA II Commitment Letter, available at: <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForIndustry/UserFees/GenericDrugUserFees/UCM525234.pdf</inline>), FDA agreed to certain review goals and procedures for the review of amendments pending as of or received on or after the GDUFA II effective date.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The GDUFA II Commitment Letter reflects significant changes in the classification of and review goals for amendments to ANDAs and PASs under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 (GDUFA I). Under GDUFA I, amendments were classified into a complex tier system based on the following factors:

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Whether the amendment was solicited (submitted in response to a complete response letter) or unsolicited (submitted on the applicant's own initiative).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Whether the amendment was major or minor.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• The number of amendments submitted to the ANDA or PAS.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Whether an inspection was necessary to support the information contained in the amendment.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">GDUFA II simplified the amendment review goals and no longer subjects them to a tier system; however, review <?page num="46068"?>goals are still dependent on several factors. In general, under GDUFA II, amendments will be designated as either standard or priority, will be classified as major or minor, and will receive a goal date based on the factors discussed in the draft guidance, including whether a preapproval inspection is needed. When finalized, this draft guidance will replace the December 2001 guidance for industry “Major, Minor, and Telephone Amendments to Abbreviated New Drug Applications.” This draft guidance supersedes the July 2014 draft guidance for industry “ANDA Submissions—Amendments and Easily Correctable Deficiencies Under GDUFA.”
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This draft guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good guidance practices regulation (<ref href="/us/cfr/t21/s10.115">21 CFR 10.115</ref>). The draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of FDA on “ANDA Submissions—Amendments to Abbreviated New Drug Applications Under GDUFA.” It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. This guidance is not subject to <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (the Committee) advises the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (the Commissioner) or designee in discharging responsibilities related to the regulation of tobacco products. The Committee reviews and evaluates safety, dependence, and health issues relating to tobacco products and provides appropriate advice, information, and recommendations to the Commissioner.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">II. Criteria for Voting Members
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Committee consists of 12 members including the Chair. Members and the Chair are selected by the Commissioner or designee from among individuals knowledgeable in the fields of medicine, medical ethics, science, or technology involving the manufacture, evaluation, or use of tobacco products. Almost all non-Federal members of this committee serve as Special Government Employees. The Committee includes nine technically qualified voting members, selected by the Commissioner or designee. The nine voting members include seven members who are physicians, dentists, scientists, or health care professionals practicing in the area of oncology, pulmonology, cardiology, toxicology, pharmacology, addiction, or any other relevant specialty. The nine voting members also include one member who is an officer or employee of a State or local government or of the Federal Government, and one member who is a representative of the general public. Almost all non-Federal members of this committee serve as Special Government Employees. Members will be invited to serve for terms of up to 4 years.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In 1984, Congress enacted the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (<ref href="/us/pl/98/417">Pub. L. 98–417</ref>) (the 1984 amendments), which authorized the approval of duplicate versions of drug products under an ANDA procedure. ANDA applicants must, with certain exceptions, show that the drug for which they are seeking approval contains the same active ingredient in the same strength and dosage form as the listed drug, which is a version of the drug that was previously approved. ANDA applicants do not have to repeat the extensive clinical testing otherwise necessary to gain approval of a new drug application (NDA).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The 1984 amendments include what is now section 505(j)(7) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t21/s355/j/7">21 U.S.C. 355(j)(7)</ref>), which requires FDA to publish a list of all approved drugs. FDA publishes this list as part of the “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” which is known generally as the Orange Book. Under FDA regulations, a drug is removed from the list if the Agency withdraws or suspends approval of the drug's NDA or ANDA for reasons of safety or effectiveness or if FDA determines that the listed drug was withdrawn from sale for reasons of safety or effectiveness (<ref href="/us/cfr/t21/s314.162">21 CFR 314.162</ref>).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A person may petition the Agency to determine, or the Agency may determine on its own initiative, whether a listed drug was withdrawn from sale for reasons of safety or effectiveness. This determination may be made at any time after the drug has been withdrawn from sale, but must be made prior to approving an ANDA that refers to the listed drug (§ 314.161 (<ref href="/us/cfr/t21/s314.161">21 CFR 314.161</ref>)). FDA may not approve an ANDA that does not refer to a listed drug.

The petitioner has identified no data or other information suggesting that SPECTAZOLE (econazole nitrate) topical cream, 1%, was withdrawn for reasons of safety or effectiveness. We have carefully reviewed our files for records concerning the withdrawal of SPECTAZOLE (econazole nitrate) topical cream, 1%, from sale. We have also independently evaluated relevant literature and data for possible postmarketing adverse events. We have reviewed the available evidence and determined that this drug product was not withdrawn from sale for reasons of safety or effectiveness.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Accordingly, the Agency will continue to list SPECTAZOLE (econazole nitrate) topical cream, 1%, in the “Discontinued Drug Product List” section of the Orange Book. The “Discontinued Drug Product List” delineates, among other items, drug products that have been discontinued from marketing for reasons other than safety or effectiveness. FDA will not begin procedures to withdraw approval of approved ANDAs that refer to this drug product. Additional ANDAs for this drug product may also be approved by the Agency as long as they meet all other legal and regulatory requirements for the approval of ANDAs. If FDA determines that labeling for this drug product should be revised to meet current standards, the Agency will advise ANDA applicants to submit such labeling.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FDA is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled “ANDA Submissions—Refuse-to-Receive Standards: Questions and Answers.” This draft guidance is intended to assist applicants preparing to submit ANDAs and certain prior approval supplements (PASs) to ANDAs. This guidance provides answers to questions we have received from applicants regarding the guidance for industry, “ANDA Submissions—Refuse-to-Receive Standards” and the filing process, in general. The questions and answers address general issues about the organization of an ANDA, filing decisions made by FDA, the review of and deficiencies related to DMFs, product quality, and BE and clinical reviews, and are intended to clarify the deficiencies that may cause FDA to RTR an ANDA. FDA evaluates each submitted ANDA individually to determine whether the Agency can receive it for review. When FDA decides to receive an ANDA, it means the Agency has made a threshold determination that the ANDA is a substantially complete application (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> an ANDA that, on its face, is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review). FDA's regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t21/s314.101">21 CFR 314.101</ref> provide the regulatory authority by which FDA may in certain cases, and will in others, RTR an ANDA.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This draft guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good guidance practices regulation (<ref href="/us/cfr/t21/s10.115">21 CFR 10.115</ref>). The draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of FDA on “ANDA Submissions—Refuse-to-Receive Standards.” It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. This guidance is not subject to <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The United States exports a large volume and variety of foods in international trade. For certain food products, foreign governments may require assurances from the responsible authority of the country of origin of an imported food that the processor of the food is in compliance with applicable country of origin regulatory requirements. With regard to U.S. milk products, FDA is the competent U.S. food safety authority to provide this information to foreign governments. FDA provides the requested information about processors in the form of lists, which are provided to the foreign governments and posted online at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/ImportsExports/Exporting/default.htm.</inline>
                                       </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Currently, FDA provides Chile, China, and the European Union (EU) with a list of U.S. milk product manufacturers/processors that: (1) Have expressed interest in exporting their products to these countries; (2) are subject to FDA's jurisdiction; and (3) are not the subject of a pending enforcement action (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> an injunction or seizure or a pending warning letter).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FDA has published guidance documents for these countries under the authority of section 701(h) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t21/s371/h">21 U.S.C. 371(h)</ref>), which authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to develop guidance documents with public participation presenting the views of the Secretary on matters under the jurisdiction of FDA.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The guidance documents explain what information manufacturers/processors should submit to FDA to be considered for inclusion on the lists and what criteria FDA intends to use to determine eligibility for placement on the lists. The guidance documents also explain how FDA intends to update the list and communicate any new information to the government that requested the list. Finally, the guidance documents note that the information is provided voluntarily by manufacturers/processors with the understanding that it will be posted on FDA's external Web site and communicated to, and possibly further disseminated by, the government that requested the list; thus, FDA considers the information on the lists to be information that is not protected from disclosure under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s552/b/4">5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Application for inclusion on each list is voluntary. However, some foreign governments may require inclusion on the list for acceptance of imported food. FDA recommends that U.S. manufacturers/processors that want to be placed on the export lists send FDA the following information: (1) Country to which the milk manufacturer/processor wants to export product; (2) type of milk product facility; (3) the Food Facility Registration Module number (the information collected by this module is approved under OMB control number 0910–0502); (4) name and address of the firm and the manufacturing plant; (5) name, telephone number, and email address of the contact person; (6) list of products divided into three categories: Presently shipped, ready to ship, and available for shipment in the next 3 years; (7) identities of Agencies that inspected the plant; (8) date of last inspection, plant number, and copy of last inspection notice; and (9) if other than an FDA inspection, copy of last inspection report.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We request that this information be updated every 2 years.







</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We use the information submitted by firms to determine their eligibility for placement on the export lists, which are published on our Web site. The purpose of the lists is to help foreign governments in their determinations of which U.S. milk product manufacturers and processors are eligible to export to their respective countries.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FDA has recently developed an electronic registry system (Form FDA 3972) that allows milk product manufacturers and processors to electronically send a request to FDA to be included on the export lists. Manufacturers and processors that prefer to submit a paper request in a format of their own choosing will still have the option to do so. Electronic Form FDA 3972 collects the same information as is currently collected via the existing paper-based process. Draft screenshots of Form FDA 3972 and instructions are available at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/ImportsExports/Exporting/ucm496929.htm</inline> and is entitled “Dairy Listing Module.”

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FDA bases its estimate on the number of manufacturers/processors that have submitted new written requests, biennial updates, and occasional updates over the past 10 years. The estimate of the number of burden hours it will take a manufacturer/processor to gather the information needed to be placed on the list or update its information is based on FDA's experience with manufacturers/processors submitting similar requests. FDA believes that the information to be submitted will be readily available to manufacturers/processors. This collection is also incorporating information collected to maintain lists of eligible exporters of dairy products who wish to export to the EU from OMB control number 0910–0320, “Request for Information from U.S. Processors that Export to the European Community.”
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FDA estimates that 2,000 firms will average 60 minutes (1 hour) to submit new requests for inclusion on the list, 2,000 firms will average 30 minutes (0.5 hour) to update their information every 2 years, and 200 firms will average 30 minutes (0.5 hour) to occasionally update their information in this system. We also believe that submission via the electronic registry system will not affect the burden estimates. An electronic registry will enhance the ability of firms to more efficiently request inclusion on export lists. FDA calculates, therefore, that the total burden for this collection is 3,100 hours ((2,000 × 1) plus (2,000 × 0.5) plus (200 × 0.5)).

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FDA is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled “ANDAs for Certain Highly Purified Synthetic Peptide Drug Products That Refer to Listed Drugs of rDNA Origin.” In general, for FDA to approve an ANDA submitted under section 505(j) of the FD&amp;C Act, an ANDA applicant must demonstrate, among other things, that the proposed generic drug has the “same” active ingredient(s) as and is bioequivalent to its reference listed drug, and that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of the proposed generic drug are adequate to assure and preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity (sections 505(j)(2)(A) and (4) (<ref href="/us/usc/t21/s355/j/2/A">21 U.S.C. 355(j)(2)(A)</ref> and (4)) of the FD&amp;C Act). If a person is seeking approval of a synthetic peptide drug product (specifically glucagon, liraglutide, nesiritide, teriparatide, or teduglutide) and intends to submit an application that refers to a previously approved peptide drug product of rDNA origin, if the active ingredient in the proposed synthetic peptide drug product can be shown to be the same as the active ingredient in the peptide drug product of rDNA origin, whether the application should be submitted as an ANDA under section 505(j) of the FD&amp;C Act or as a new drug application under section 505(b) of the FD&amp;C Act will depend largely on the impurity profile for the synthetic peptide drug product as compared to the impurity profile for the peptide drug product of rDNA origin. Differences in impurities, particularly peptide-related impurities, may affect the safety or effectiveness of a peptide drug product. This draft guidance is intended to assist potential applicants in determining when an application for a synthetic peptide drug product that refers to a previously approved peptide drug product of rDNA origin should be submitted as an ANDA rather than an NDA.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This draft guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good guidance practices regulation (<ref href="/us/cfr/t21/s10.115">21 CFR 10.115</ref>). The draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of FDA on the submission of ANDAs for certain highly purified synthetic peptide drug products that refer to listed drugs of rDNA origin. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. This draft guidance is not subject to <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This draft guidance refers to previously approved collections of information that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (<ref href="/us/usc/t44/s3501–3520">44 U.S.C. 3501–3520</ref>).

The guidance updates the Quality-related sections of the Granularity Document Annex, Module 2.3 Quality Overall Summary, and Module 3 Quality. The guidance is intended to provide recommendations on the organization of the common technical document (CTD)/eCTD and replaces the August 2001 FDA guidance for industry “M4: Organization of the CTD” and the October 2005 FDA guidance for industry “Granularity Document Annex to M4: Organization of the CTD.”

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">I. Background
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In recent years, many important initiatives have been undertaken by regulatory authorities and industry associations to promote international harmonization of regulatory requirements. FDA has participated in many meetings designed to enhance harmonization and is committed to seeking scientifically-based harmonized technical procedures for pharmaceutical development. One of the goals of harmonization is to identify and then reduce differences in technical requirements for drug development among regulatory agencies.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for harmonization initiatives to be developed with input from both regulatory and industry representatives. FDA also seeks input from consumer representatives and others. ICH is concerned with harmonization of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products for human use among regulators around the world. The six founding members of the ICH are the European Commission; the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations; the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare; the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association; CDER and CBER, FDA; and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. The Standing Members of the ICH Association include Health Canada and Swissmedic. Any party eligible as a member in accordance with the ICH Articles of Association can apply for membership in writing to the ICH Secretariat. The ICH Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation of documentation, operates as an international nonprofit organization and is funded by the members of the ICH Association.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The ICH Assembly is the overarching body of the Association and includes representatives from each of the ICH members and observers.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The M4 guidance provides guidance on the organization of the CTD and eCTD for Modules 2 through 5 providing direction on the location and hierarchy of headings within modules, document pagination and segregation, section numbering within documents, and the formatting of the table of contents. The guidance updates the Quality-related sections of the Granularity Document Annex, Module 2.3 Quality Overall Summary, and Module 3 Quality. The guidance provides separate tables describing the recommended granularity for paper and eCTD v3.2.2 submissions, and for paper and eCTD v4 submissions, and includes “Appendices for eCTD v4 Submissions” to facilitate the implementation of the next major version of the eCTD. This guidance replaces both the August 2001 FDA GIF “M4: Organization of the CTD” and the October 2005 FDA GIF “Granularity Document Annex to M4: Organization of the CTD.” This merger reflects the 2002 addition of the Annex: Granularity Document into the “M4 Organization of the Common Technical Document for the Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.”
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">There have been no updates or changes relative to Module 4 or Module 5.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good guidance practices regulation (<ref href="/us/cfr/t21/s10.115">21 CFR 10.115</ref>). The guidance represents the current thinking of FDA on the organization of the CTD for the registration of pharmaceuticals for human use. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2015-10-05">October 5, 2015</date>, FDA launched the REMS Platform Standards Initiative (previously referred to as the “Common REMS Platform Initiative”), with the goal of developing and leveraging electronic health data standards, referred to as “REMS platform standards,” to further standardize certain activities associated with REMS with elements to assure safe use (ETASU), and integrate them into existing health care systems. (Information about the initiative can be found at: <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForIndustry/UserFees/PrescriptionDrugUserFee/UCM507451.pdf</inline>). Since then, FDA has been working to determine the most effective methods for carrying out this initiative, including how best to engage the public on the project and advance the development of REMS platform standards. To achieve these ends, FDA is publishing the “REMS Platform Standards Initiative: Needs Assessment,” which seeks to provide REMS stakeholders, standards developers, and health information technology (IT) systems developers with specific, detailed information on the areas in which standards development is needed and the information that the data standards would need to communicate to effectively carry out REMS activities. FDA seeks comment on the document as a whole, as well as on the specific questions that follow.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(1) Does this needs assessment cover all of the REMS activities for which standards development would be beneficial?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(2) Which REMS activities should be given highest priority for standards development?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(3) What standards already exist that could be used to address the needs and facilitate the REMS activities described in the needs assessment?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(4) Where (if at all) do new standards need to be developed?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(5) What other opportunities exist to leverage health IT to facilitate the completion of REMS activities?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FDA hopes that the needs assessment will help identify areas where standards development projects to support REMS are already underway, as well as areas that are ripe for standards development, enabling interested stakeholders to engage further in this project.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">What is the REMS Platform Standards Initiative?
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The goal of the REMS Platform Standards Initiative is to leverage electronic health data standards to standardize certain activities in REMS with ETASU and integrate them into health IT systems. Under the initiative, FDA seeks to work with third-party standards development organizations to encourage the development of electronic data standards that may be used to facilitate communication between REMS and their participants. Once the standards are developed, FDA would maintain a list of REMS platform standards, encourage their use in REMS with ETASU, and encourage the development of tools that use these standards to integrate REMS into health care providers' existing systems.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Why is FDA launching the REMS Platform Standards Initiative?
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This initiative was launched for a number of reasons. Stakeholders have requested a centralized method to enroll in and interact with REMS with ETASU and more fundamental standardization of REMS architecture. There is also a need for a comprehensive set of standards for REMS to help minimize REMS burden on the health care delivery system and integrate REMS into health IT systems.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The goal of the REMS Platform Standards Initiative is to give all stakeholders—including sponsors, data vendors, clinical decision support system developers (such as those for hospitals, private practices, etc.)—a “fixed target” for standardization and integration. If successful, this will clarify how sponsors can develop standardized REMS that are more easily integrated into the health care system and what health care providers must do to comply with those REMS. Ultimately, REMS that are more effectively standardized and integrated into the health care system should facilitate enhanced compliance and safer use of drugs that have REMS.

Background:</inline> The proposed information collection activities described in this notice will provide data for the randomized controlled trial (RCT) and quasi-experimentally designed (QED) studies and implementation evaluation of the Youth CareerConnect program. In spring 2014, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) in the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) awarded a total of $107 million to 24 grantees to implement the YCC program. The program is a high school based initiative aimed at improving students' college and career readiness in particular employment sectors. The programs are redesigning the high school experience through partnerships with colleges and employers to provide skill-developing and work-based learning opportunities to help students prepare for jobs in high-demand occupations.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The evaluation will address three main research questions: (1) What was the impact of the YCC programs on students' short-term outcomes? (2) How were the YCC programs implemented? and (3) Did the effectiveness of YCC programs vary by student characteristics? The RCT and QED will estimate program effectiveness and will <?page num="46091"?>be carried out in a subset of YCC grantees. An implementation study will draw on data gathered from all YCC grantees.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This request is part of a larger study which has had other components approved under prior clearance numbers. The YCC Participant Tracking System (PTS) was approved on <date date="2015-03-20">March 20, 2015</date> under OMB Control No 1291–0002. Data collection instruments used for the baseline portion of the RCT and the instruments used for the implementation study were approved on <date date="2015-04-15">April 15, 2015</date> under OMB Control No 1291–0003.

This program helps to assure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. Currently, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is soliciting comments on the information collection for Training Plan Regulations and Certificate of Training.

Further, section 101(a) of the Mine Act, <ref href="/us/usc/t30/s811">30 U.S.C. 811</ref>, authorizes the Secretary of Labor <?page num="46092"?>(Secretary) to develop, promulgate, and revise as may be appropriate, improved mandatory health or safety standards for the protection of life and prevention of injuries in coal or other mines.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Mine Act, as amended, <ref href="/us/usc/t30/s801">30 U.S.C. 801</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.,</inline> recognizes that education and training is an important element of federal efforts to make the nation's mines safe. Title 30, CFR Sections 48.3 and 48.23 require training plans for underground and surface mines, respectively. The standards are intended to assure that miners will be effectively trained in matters affecting their health and safety, with the ultimate goal being the reduction of injuries and illness in the nation's mines. Training plans are required to be submitted for approval to the MSHA District Manager for the area in which the mine is located. Plans must contain the company name, mine name, and MSHA identification number of the mine; the name and position of the person designated by the operator who is responsible for health and safety training at the mine; a list of MSHA approved instructors with whom the operator proposes to make arrangements to teach the courses and the courses each instructor is qualified to teach; the location where training will be given for each course; a description of the teaching methods and the course materials which are to be used in training; the approximate number of miners employed at the mine and the maximum number who will attend each session of training; the predicted time or periods of time when regularly scheduled refresher training will be given including the titles of courses to be taught, the total number of instruction hours for each course, and the predicted time and length of each session of training; and for new task training, a complete list of task assignments, the titles of personnel conducting the training, the outline of training procedures used, and the evaluation procedures used to determine the effectiveness of the training. Records of training are required for underground and surface mines under sections 48.9 and 48.29.

The applicant proposes to operate a small, battery-operated remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) consisting, in part, of a quadcopter equipped with a camera to collect commercial and educational footage of the Antarctic, as well as for ice reconnaissance. The quadcopter would not be flown over concentrations of birds or mammals, or over Antarctic Specially Protected Areas. The RPAS would only be operated by pilots with extensive experience (≤20 hours), who are pre-approved by the Expedition Leader. Several Measures would be taken to prevent against loss of the quadcopter including a highly visible paint color; only operating when the wind is less than 25 knots; operating for only 15 minutes at a time to preserve battery life; having prop guards on propeller tips; using a flotation device if operated over water; a “fail-safe and auto go home” feature in the case of a loss of control link or low battery; having an observer on the lookout for wildlife, people, and other hazards; and ensuring that the separation between the operator and quadcopter does not exceed an operational range of 500 meters. The applicant is seeking a Waste Permit to cover any accidental releases that may result from operating the RPAS.

The applicant proposes to operate small, battery-operated remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) consisting, in part, of a quadcopter equipped with cameras to collect commercial and educational footage of the Antarctic. The quadcopter would not be flown over concentrations of birds or mammals, or over Antarctic Specially Protected Areas or Historic Sites and Monuments. The RPAS would only be operated by pilots with extensive experience, who are pre-approved by the Expedition Leader. Several measures would be taken to prevent against loss of the quadcopter including painting them a highly visible color; only flying when the wind is less than 25 knots; flying for only 15 minutes at a time to preserve battery life; having prop guards on propeller tips, a flotation device if operated over water, and an “auto go home” feature in case of loss of control link or low battery; having an observer on the lookout for wildlife, people, and other hazards; and ensuring that the separation between the operator and quadcopter does not exceed an operational range of 500 meters. The applicant is seeking a Waste Permit to cover any accidental releases that may result from operating the RPAS.

The amendment requests are for Hope Creek Generating Station, R.E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant, and Wolf Creek Generating Station. For each amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that they involve no significant hazards consideration. Because the amendment requests contain sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI) and safeguards information (SGI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI and SGI for contention preparation.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Pursuant to Section 189a.(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), the NRC is publishing this notice. The Act requires the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued and grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license or combined license, as applicable, upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This notice includes notices of amendments containing SUNSI and/or SGI.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">III. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses and Combined Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in § 50.92 of 10 CFR, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for each amendment request is shown below.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The Commission may issue the license amendment before expiration of the 60-day period provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. In addition, the Commission may issue the amendment prior to the expiration of the 30-day comment period if circumstances change during the 30-day comment period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility. If the Commission takes action prior to the expiration of either the comment period or the notice period, it will publish a notice of issuance in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>. If the Commission makes a final no significant hazards consideration determination, any hearing will take place after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any persons (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene (petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's “Agency Rules of Practice and Procedure” in <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/p2">10 CFR part 2</ref>. Interested persons should consult a current copy of <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s2.309">10 CFR 2.309</ref>.

If a petition is filed, the Commission or a presiding officer will rule on the petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As required by <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s2.309/d">10 CFR 2.309(d)</ref> the petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following general requirements for standing: (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the petitioner; (2) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (3) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (4) the possible effect of any decision or order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In accordance with <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s2.309/f">10 CFR 2.309(f)</ref>, the petition must also set forth the specific contentions which the petitioner seeks to have litigated in the proceeding. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner must provide a brief explanation of the bases for the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to the specific sources and documents on which the petitioner intends to rely to support its position on the issue. The petition must include sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant or licensee on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions must be limited to matters within the scope of the proceeding. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to satisfy the requirements at <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s2.309/f">10 CFR 2.309(f)</ref> with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene. Parties have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing with respect to resolution of that party's admitted contentions, including the opportunity to present evidence, consistent with the NRC's regulations, policies, and procedures.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates good cause by satisfying the three factors in <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s2.309/c/1/i">10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i)</ref> through (iii). The petition must be filed in accordance with the filing instructions in the “Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)” section of this document.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">If a hearing is requested, and the Commission has not made a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to establish when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, <?page num="46096"?>notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule under <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/p2">10 CFR part 2</ref>.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A State, local governmental body, Federally-recognized Indian Tribe, or agency thereof, may submit a petition to the Commission to participate as a party under <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s2.309/h/1">10 CFR 2.309(h)(1)</ref>. The petition should state the nature and extent of the petitioner's interest in the proceeding. The petition should be submitted to the Commission no later than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. The petition must be filed in accordance with the filing instructions in the “Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)” section of this document, and should meet the requirements for petitions set forth in this section, except that under <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s2.309/h/2">10 CFR 2.309(h)(2)</ref>, a State, local governmental body, or Federally-recognized Indian Tribe, or agency thereof does not need to address the standing requirements in <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s2.309/d">10 CFR 2.309(d)</ref> if the facility is located within its boundaries. Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally-recognized Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s2.315/c">10 CFR 2.315(c)</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">If a hearing is granted, any person who is not a party to the proceeding and is not affiliated with or represented by a party may, at the discretion of the presiding officer, be permitted to make a limited appearance pursuant to the provisions of <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s2.315/a">10 CFR 2.315(a)</ref>. A person making a limited appearance may make an oral or written statement of his or her position on the issues but may not otherwise participate in the proceeding. A limited appearance may be made at any session of the hearing or at any prehearing conference, subject to the limits and conditions as may be imposed by the presiding officer. Details regarding the opportunity to make a limited appearance will be provided by the presiding officer if such sessions are scheduled.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including a request for hearing and petition for leave to intervene (petition), any motion or other document filed in the proceeding prior to the submission of a request for hearing or petition to intervene, and documents filed by interested governmental entities that request to participate under <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s2.315/c">10 CFR 2.315(c)</ref>, must be filed in accordance with the NRC's E-Filing rule (<ref href="/us/fr/72/49139">72 FR 49139</ref>; <date date="2007-08-28">August 28, 2007</date>, as amended at <ref href="/us/fr/77/46562">77 FR 46562</ref>; <date date="2012-08-03">August 3, 2012</date>). The E-Filing process requires participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the internet, or in some cases to mail copies on electronic storage media. Detailed guidance on making electronic submissions may be found in the Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC and on the NRC Web site at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.</inline> Participants may not submit paper copies of their filings unless they seek an exemption in accordance with the procedures described below.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the Office of the Secretary by email at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">hearing.docket@nrc.gov,</inline> or by telephone at 301–415–1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the hearing in this proceeding if the Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is available on the NRC's public Web site at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html.</inline> Once a participant has obtained a digital ID certificate and a docket has been created, the participant can then submit adjudicatory documents. Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (PDF). Additional guidance on PDF submissions is available on the NRC's public Web site at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html.</inline> A filing is considered complete at the time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the due date. Upon receipt of a transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends the submitter an email notice confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing system also distributes an email notice that provides access to the document to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants (or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed so that they can obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.

Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner are responsible for serving the document on all other participants. Filing is considered complete by first-class mail as of the time of deposit in the mail, or by courier, express mail, or expedited delivery service upon depositing the document with the provider of the service. A presiding officer, having granted an exemption request from using E-Filing, may require a participant or party to use E-Filing if the presiding officer subsequently determines that the reason for granting the exemption from use of E-Filing no longer exists.

The reviews and evaluations determined that these structures, systems, and components are capable of performing their design function at the proposed uprated RTP of 3902 MWt. Accident mitigation systems will function as designed. The performance requirements for these systems have been evaluated and found acceptable. Thus, the proposed changes do not create any new accident initiators or increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated.

Thus, there is no increase in the probability of a structural failure from these components. The safety relief valves and containment isolation valves meet design sizing requirements at the uprated power level. Because the plant integrity will not be affected by operation at the uprated condition, PSEG Nuclear LLC (PSEG) has concluded that all structures, systems, and components required to mitigate a transient remain capable of fulfilling their intended functions.

Source terms used to assess radiological consequences have been determined to bound operation at the uprated power level.

The proposed change will not adversely affect accident initiators or precursors nor adversely alter the design assumptions and conditions of the facility or the manner in which the plant is operated and maintained with respect to such initiators or precursors.
</p>
                                          <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed change will not alter or prevent the capability of structures, systems, and components (SSCs) to perform their intended functions for mitigating the consequences of an accident and meeting applicable acceptance limits.
</p>
                                          <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

</p>
                                          <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">No new accident scenarios, transient precursors, failure mechanisms, or limiting single failures will be introduced as a result of this amendment. No new or different accidents result from addition of the proposed specification. The Class 1E electrical equipment A/C trains maintain the capability to perform their specified safety function. The proposed license amendment includes regulatory commitments to achieve the capability for one OPERABLE Class 1E electrical equipment A/C train to provide adequate cooling for both trains of electrical equipment during normal and accident conditions by design changes. [The planned modifications proposed by regulatory commitments will be implemented under the requirements of <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s50.59">10 CFR 50.59</ref>.]
</p>
                                          <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed amendment will not alter the design or performance of the 7300 Process Protection System, Nuclear Instrumentation System, Solid State Protection System, Balance of Plant Engineered Safety Features Actuation System, Main Steam and Feedwater Isolation System, or Load Shedder and Emergency Load Sequencers used in the plant protection systems.
</p>
                                          <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed change adds requirements in the TSs that were previously located in plant procedures. One OPERABLE Class 1E electrical equipment A/C train is capable of providing adequate area cooling for both trains of Class 1E electrical equipment during normal and accident conditions (with mitigating actions being required). The change does not have a detrimental impact on the manner in which plant equipment operates or responds to an actuation signal.
</p>
                                          <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

</p>
                                          <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed specification allows for a period of time in which one Class 1E electrical equipment A/C train is capable of providing adequate area cooling for both trains of Class 1E electrical equipment during normal and accident conditions (with mitigating actions being required). The proposed change does not impact accident offsite dose, containment pressure or temperature, Emergency Core Cooling System settings or Reactor Protection System settings, or any other parameter that could affect a margin of safety. The margin of safety is enhanced by periodically verifying the area room temperatures are maintained within limit while one Class 1E electrical equipment A/C train is inoperable and allowing a reasonable period to perform preventive and corrective maintenance thus increasing system reliability.
</p>
                                          <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of shares of the Funds may violate section 18(a)(2) because the Funds may not meet such requirements with respect to a class of shares that may be a senior security.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">2. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a closed-end investment company may not issue or sell any senior security if, immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one class of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of shares of the Funds may be prohibited by section 18(c), as a class may have priority over another class as to payment of dividends because shareholders of different classes would pay different fees and expenses.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">3. Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock. Applicants state that multiple classes of shares of the Funds may violate section 18(i) of the Act because each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class.

Applicants submit that the proposed arrangements would permit a Fund to facilitate the distribution of its shares and provide investors with a broader choice of shareholder services. Applicants assert that the proposed closed-end investment company multiple class structure does not raise the concerns underlying section 18 of the Act to any greater degree than open-end investment companies' multiple class structures that are permitted by rule 18f–3 under the Act.

Rule 23c–3 under the Act permits a registered closed-end investment company (an “interval fund”) to make repurchase offers of between five and twenty-five percent of its outstanding shares at net asset value at periodic intervals pursuant to a fundamental policy of the interval fund. Rule 23c–3(b)(1) under the Act permits an interval fund to deduct from repurchase proceeds only a repurchase fee, not to exceed two percent of the proceeds, that is paid to the interval fund and is reasonably intended to compensate the fund for expenses directly related to the repurchase. A Fund will not impose a repurchase fee on investors who purchase and tender their shares.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">3. Section 23(c)(3) provides that the Commission may issue an order that would permit a closed-end investment company to repurchase its shares in circumstances in which the repurchase is made in a manner or on a basis that does not unfairly discriminate against any holders of the class or classes of securities to be purchased.

Applicants state that the early withdrawal charges they intend to impose are functionally similar to contingent deferred sales loads imposed by open-end investment companies under rule 6c–10 under the Act. Rule 6c–10 permits open-end investment companies to impose contingent deferred sales loads, subject to certain conditions. Applicants note that rule 6c–10 is grounded in policy considerations supporting the employment of contingent deferred sales loads where there are adequate safeguards for the investor and state that the same policy considerations support imposition of early withdrawal charges in the interval fund context. In addition, applicants state that early withdrawal charges may be necessary for the distributor to recover distribution costs. Applicants represent that any early withdrawal charge imposed by the Funds will comply with rule 6c–10 under the Act as if the rule were applicable to closed-end investment companies. The Funds will disclose early withdrawal charges in accordance with the requirements of Form N–1A concerning contingent deferred sales loads.

Applicants have agreed to comply with rules 12b–1 and 17d–3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies, which they believe will resolve any concerns that might arise in connection with a Fund financing the distribution of its shares through asset-based distribution and/or service fees.

The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, enacted on <date date="2012-04-05">April 5, 2012</date>, added Section 6(e) to the Securities Act. Section 6(e) of the Securities Act provides that an “emerging growth company” may confidentially submit to the Commission a draft registration statement for confidential, non-public review by the Commission staff prior to public filing, provided that the initial confidential submission and all amendments thereto shall be publicly filed not later than 21 days before the date on which the issuer conducts a road show, as such term is defined in Securities Act Rule 433(h)(4). An emerging growth company is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act as an issuer with less than $1,000,000,000 total annual gross revenues during its most recently completed fiscal year. The Trust meets the definition of an emerging growth company and consequently has submitted its Form S–1 Registration Statement on a confidential basis with the Commission.</p>

The Trust will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, “commodity interests”, or any other instruments regulated by the Commodities Exchange Act. The Trust will take delivery of physical palladium that complies with the LPPM palladium delivery rules.

Although the Shares are not the exact equivalent of an investment in palladium, they provide investors with an alternative that allows a level of participation in the palladium market through the securities market.

                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Operation of the Palladium Market
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The global trade in palladium consists of OTC transactions in spot, forwards, and options and other derivatives, together with exchange-traded futures and options.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Most trading in physical palladium is conducted on the OTC market, predominantly in Zurich and London. The LPPM coordinates various OTC market activities, including clearing and vaulting, acts as the principal intermediary between physical palladium market participants and the relevant regulators, promotes good trading practices and develops standard market documentation. In addition, the LPPM promotes refining standards for the palladium market by maintaining the “London/Zurich Good Delivery List,” which are the lists of LPPM accredited melters and assayers of palladium.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The basis for settlement and delivery of a spot trade is payment (generally in US dollars) two business days after the trade date against delivery. Delivery of the palladium can either be by physical delivery or through the clearing systems to an unallocated account. The unit of trade in London and Zurich is the troy ounce, whose conversion between grams is: 1,000 grams is equivalent to 32.1507465 troy ounces, and one troy ounce is equivalent to 31.1034768 grams.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A good delivery palladium plate or ingot is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market (a “Good Delivery Palladium Plate or Ingot”). A Good Delivery Palladium Plate or Ingot must contain between 32 and 192 troy ounces of palladium with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 999.5 parts per 1,000 (99.95%), be of good appearance, and be easy to handle and stack. A Good Delivery Palladium Plate or Ingot must also bear the stamp of one of the melters and assayers who are on the LPPM approved list. Unless otherwise specified, the palladium spot price always refers to the “Good Delivery Standards” set by the LPPM.
</p>
                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Creation and Redemption of Shares
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Trust will create and redeem Shares on a continuous basis in one or more blocks of 15,000 Shares (a block of 15,000 Shares is called a “Basket”). As described below, the Trust will issue Shares in Baskets to certain authorized participants (“Authorized Participants”) on an ongoing basis. Baskets of Shares will only be issued or redeemed in exchange for an amount of palladium represented by the aggregate number of Shares redeemed. No Shares will be issued unless the Custodian has allocated to the Trust's account the corresponding amount of palladium. Initially, a Basket will require delivery of 1,500 fine ounces of palladium. The amount of palladium necessary for the creation of a Basket, or to be received upon redemption of a Basket, will decrease over the life of the Trust, due to the payment or accrual of fees and other expenses or liabilities payable by the Trust.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Baskets may be created or redeemed only by Authorized Participants. Orders must be placed by 3:59 p.m. Eastern Time (“E.T.”). The day on which a Trust receives a valid purchase or redemption order is the order date.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Each Authorized Participant must be a registered broker-dealer, a participant in Depository Trust Corporation (“DTC”), have entered into an agreement with the Trustee (the “Authorized Participant Agreement”) and have established a palladium unallocated account with the Custodian or a physical palladium clearing bank. The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of palladium in connection with such creations or redemptions.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">According to the Registration Statement, Authorized Participants may surrender Baskets of Shares in exchange for the corresponding Basket Amount announced by the Trustee. Upon surrender of such Shares and payment of the Trustee's applicable fee and of any expenses, taxes or charges (such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees), the Trustee will deliver to the order of the redeeming Authorized Participant the amount of palladium corresponding to the redeemed Baskets. Shares can only be surrendered for redemption in Baskets of 15,000 Shares each.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Before surrendering Baskets of Shares for redemption, an Authorized Participant must deliver to the Trustee a written request indicating the number of Baskets it intends to redeem. The date the Trustee receives that order determines the Basket Amount to be <?page num="46108"?>received in exchange. However, orders received by the Trustee after 3:59 p.m. E.T. on a business day or on a business day when the LBMA Palladium Price PM or other applicable benchmark price is not announced, will not be accepted.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The redemption distribution from the Trust will consist of a credit to the redeeming Authorized Participant's unallocated account representing the amount of the palladium held by the Trust evidenced by the Shares being redeemed as of the date of the redemption order.

                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Net Asset Value
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The NAV of the Trust will be calculated by subtracting the Trust's expenses and liabilities on any day from the value of the palladium owned by the Trust on that day; the NAV per Share will be obtained by dividing the NAV of the Trust on a given day by the number of Shares outstanding on that day. On each day on which the Exchange is open for regular trading, the Trustee will determine the NAV as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m. E.T. The Trustee will value the Trust's palladium based on the most recently announced LBMA Palladium Price PM or LBMA Palladium Price AM. If neither price is available for that day, the Trustee will value the Trust's palladium based on the most recently announced LBMA Palladium Price PM or LBMA Palladium Price AM. If the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate to use, the Sponsor will identify an alternate basis for evaluation to be employed by the Trustee. Further, the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to use on an on-going basis a different publicly available price which the Sponsor determines to fairly represent the commercial value of the Trust's palladium.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The NAV per Share will be calculated by taking the current price of the Trust's total assets, subtracting any liabilities, and dividing by the total number of Shares outstanding. Authorized Participants will offer Shares at an offering price that will vary, depending on, among other factors, the price of palladium and the trading price of the Shares on the Exchange at the time of offer. Authorized Participants will not receive from the Trust, the Sponsor, the Trustee or any of their affiliates any fee or other compensation in connection with the offering of the Shares.
</p>
                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Secondary Market Trading
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">While the Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of palladium less the Trust's expenses and liabilities, Shares may trade at, above or below their NAV. The NAV of Shares will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Trust's assets. The trading prices of Shares will fluctuate in accordance with changes in their NAV as well as market supply and demand. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the major palladium markets and the Exchange. While the Shares trade on the Exchange until 4:00 p.m. E.T., liquidity in the market for palladium may be reduced after the close of the major world palladium markets, including London, Zurich and COMEX. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on Shares may widen.

</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Currently, the Consolidated Tape Plan does not provide for dissemination of the spot price of a commodity such as palladium over the Consolidated Tape. However, there will be disseminated over the Consolidated Tape the last sale price for the Shares, as is the case for all equity securities traded on the Exchange (including exchange-traded funds). In addition, there is a considerable amount of information about palladium and palladium markets available on public Web sites and through professional and subscription services.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Reuters and Bloomberg provide at no charge on their Web sites delayed information regarding the spot price of palladium and last sale prices of palladium futures, as well as information about news and developments in the palladium market. Reuters and Bloomberg also offer a professional service to subscribers for a fee that provides information on palladium prices directly from market participants. ICAP plc provides an electronic trading platform called EBS for the trading of spot palladium, as well as a feed of real-time streaming prices, delivered as record-based digital data from the EBS platform to its customer's market data platform via Bloomberg or Reuters.

Trading in the Shares on the Exchange will occur in accordance with NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.34(a). The Exchange has appropriate rules to facilitate transactions in the Shares during all trading sessions. As provided in NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.6, Commentary .03, the minimum price variation (“MPV”) for quoting and entry of orders in equity securities traded on the NYSE Arca Marketplace is $0.01, with the exception of securities that are priced less than $1.00 for which the MPV for order entry is $0.0001.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Further, NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.201 [sic] sets forth certain restrictions on ETP Holders acting as registered Market Makers in the Shares to facilitate surveillance. Under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.201(g) [sic], an ETP Holder acting as a registered Market Maker in the Shares is required to provide the Exchange with information relating to its trading in the underlying palladium, related futures or options on futures, or any other related derivatives. Commentary .04 of NYSE Arca Equities Rule 6.3 requires an ETP Holder acting as a registered Market Maker, and its affiliates, in the Shares to establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of any material nonpublic information with respect to such products, any components of the related products, any physical asset or commodity underlying the product, applicable currencies, underlying indexes, related futures or options on futures, and any related derivative instruments (including the Shares).

A subsidiary or affiliate of an ETP Holder that does business only in commodities or futures contracts would not be subject to Exchange jurisdiction, but the Exchange could obtain information regarding the activities of such subsidiary or affiliate through surveillance sharing agreements with regulatory organizations of which such subsidiary or affiliate is a member.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">With respect to trading halts, the Exchange may consider all relevant factors in exercising its discretion to halt or suspend trading in the Shares. Trading on the Exchange in the Shares may be halted because of market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in the Shares inadvisable. These may include: (1) The extent to which conditions in the underlying palladium market have caused disruptions and/or lack of trading, or (2) whether other unusual conditions or circumstances detrimental to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market are present. In addition, trading in Shares will be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to the Exchange's “circuit breaker” rule.<ref id="fnd2e11866" idref="fnd2e11872" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">17</ref> The Exchange will halt trading in the Shares if the NAV of the Trust is not calculated or disseminated daily.

Specifically, the Information Bulletin will discuss the following: (1) The procedures for purchases and redemptions of Shares in Baskets (including noting that Shares are not individually redeemable); (2) NYSE Arca Equities Rule 9.2(a), which imposes a duty of due diligence on its ETP Holders to learn the essential facts <?page num="46110"?>relating to every customer prior to trading the Shares; (3) how information regarding the IIV is disseminated; (4) the requirement that ETP Holders deliver a prospectus to investors purchasing newly issued Shares prior to or concurrently with the confirmation of a transaction; (5) the possibility that trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the Shares may widen as a result of reduced liquidity of palladium trading during the Core and Late Trading Sessions after the close of the major world palladium markets; and (6) trading information. For example, the Information Bulletin will advise ETP Holders, prior to the commencement of trading, of the prospectus delivery requirements applicable to the Trust. The Exchange notes that investors purchasing Shares directly from the Trust (by delivery of the Creation Basket Deposit) will receive a prospectus. ETP Holders purchasing Shares from the Trust for resale to investors will deliver a prospectus to such investors.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, the Information Bulletin will reference that the Trust is subject to various fees and expenses as will be described in the Registration Statement. The Information Bulletin will also reference the fact that there is no regulated source of last sale information regarding physical palladium, that the Commission has no jurisdiction over the trading of palladium as a physical commodity, and that the CFTC has regulatory jurisdiction over the trading of palladium futures contracts and options on palladium futures contracts.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Information Bulletin will also discuss any relief, if granted, by the Commission or the staff from any rules under the Act.

The purpose of the Exchange's proposal is to establish: (1) Trading rules enabling MIAX Options Members to trade index options on the Exchange and (2) generic listing standards and maintenance standards to permit the Exchange to list “broad-based” and “narrow-based” index options on the Exchange pursuant to Rule 19b–4(e) under the Act.<ref id="fnd2e12165" idref="fnd2e12179" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">4</ref> The proposed generic listing and maintenance standards for broad-based indices listed and traded on the Exchange require, among other things, that options on the index be a.m.-settled; that the index be capitalization-weighted, modified capitalization-weighted, price-weighted, or equal dollar-weighted; and that the index be comprised of at least fifty securities, all of which must be “NMS stocks,” as defined in Rule 600 of Regulation NMS.<ref id="fnd2e12169" idref="fnd2e12190" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">5</ref> The proposed generic listing and maintenance standards for narrow-based indices require, among other characteristics, that the proposed indices must consist of ten or more component securities.<ref id="fnd2e12173" idref="fnd2e12198" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">6</ref>

</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Commission believes that trading options on an index of securities (including a narrow-based index) permits investors to participate in the price movements of the index's underlying securities and allows investors holding positions in some or all of such securities to hedge the risks associated with their portfolios. The Commission further believes that trading options on an index provides investors with an important trading and hedging mechanism that is designed to reflect accurately the overall movement of the component stocks. In particular, the Commission believes that the proposed position and exercise limits should serve to minimize potential manipulation concerns.

Thus, the Commission believes that the satisfaction of these requirements significantly minimizes the potential for manipulation of the index.

When a new derivative securities product based upon domestic securities is listed and traded on an exchange pursuant to Rule 19b–4(e) under the Act, the exchange should determine that the markets upon which all of the U.S. component securities trade are members of the ISG, which provides information relevant to the surveillance of the trading of securities on other market centers.<ref id="fnd2e12564" idref="fnd2e12580" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">32</ref> In this regard, all of the registered national securities exchanges, including the Exchange, as <?page num="46114"?>well as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), are members of the ISG.

All orders to purchase Creation Units and all redemption requests will be placed by or through an “Authorized Participant,” which will have signed a participant agreement with a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) (the “Distributor”). Shares will be listed and traded individually on a national securities exchange, where share prices will be based on the current bid/offer market. Certain Funds may operate as Feeder Funds in a master-feeder structure. Any order granting the requested relief would be subject to the terms and conditions stated in the application.

Any Fund will (a) be advised by the Initial Adviser or an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Initial Adviser (each, an “Adviser”) and (b) comply with the terms and conditions of the application.</p>

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">2. Each Fund will consist of a portfolio of securities and other assets and investment positions (“Portfolio Instruments”). Each Fund will disclose on its Web site the identities and quantities of the Portfolio Instruments that will form the basis for the Fund's calculation of NAV at the end of the day.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">3. Shares will be purchased and redeemed in Creation Units and generally on an in-kind basis. Except where the purchase or redemption will include cash under the limited circumstances specified in the <?page num="46115"?>application, purchasers will be required to purchase Creation Units by depositing specified instruments (“Deposit Instruments”), and shareholders redeeming their shares will receive specified instruments (“Redemption Instruments”). The Deposit Instruments and the Redemption Instruments will each correspond pro rata to the positions in the Fund's portfolio (including cash positions) except as specified in the application.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">4. Because shares will not be individually redeemable, applicants request an exemption from section 5(a)(1) and section 2(a)(32) of the Act that would permit the Funds to register as open-end management investment companies and issue shares that are redeemable in Creation Units only.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">5. Applicants also request an exemption from section 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c–1 under the Act as secondary market trading in shares will take place at negotiated prices, not at a current offering price described in a Fund's prospectus, and not at a price based on NAV. Applicants state that (a) secondary market trading in shares does not involve a Fund as a party and will not result in dilution of an investment in shares, and (b) to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day, or from day to day, such variances occur as a result of third-party market forces, such as supply and demand. Therefore, applicants assert that secondary market transactions in shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers. Finally, applicants represent that share market prices will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities, which should prevent shares from trading at a material discount or premium from NAV.









 
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">6. With respect to Funds that hold non-U.S. Portfolio Instruments and that effect creations and redemptions of Creation Units in kind, applicants request relief from the requirement imposed by section 22(e) in order to allow such Funds to pay redemption proceeds within fifteen calendar days following the tender of Creation Units for redemption. Applicants assert that the requested relief would not be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of section 22(e) to prevent unreasonable, undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the actual payment of redemption proceeds.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">7. Applicants request an exemption to permit Funds of Funds to acquire Fund shares beyond the limits of section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act; and the Funds, and any principal underwriter for the Funds, and/or any broker or dealer registered under the Exchange Act, to sell shares to Funds of Funds beyond the limits of section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act. The application's terms and conditions are designed to, among other things, help prevent any potential (i) undue influence over a Fund through control or voting power, or in connection with certain services, transactions, and underwritings, (ii) excessive layering of fees, and (iii) overly complex fund structures, which are the concerns underlying the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">8. Applicants request an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act to permit a person who is an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act (“Affiliated Person”), or an affiliated person of an Affiliated Person (“Second-Tier Affiliate”), of the Funds, solely by virtue of certain ownership interests, to effectuate purchases and redemptions in-kind. The deposit procedures for in-kind purchases of Creation Units and the redemption procedures for in-kind redemptions of Creation Units will be the same for all purchases and redemptions and Deposit Instruments and Redemption Instruments will be valued in the same manner as those Portfolio Instruments currently held by the Funds. Applicants also seek relief from the prohibitions on affiliated transactions in section 17(a) to permit a Fund to sell its shares to and redeem its shares from a Fund of Funds, and to engage in the accompanying in-kind transactions with the Fund of Funds.<ref id="fnd2e12741" idref="fnd2e12747" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">2</ref> The purchase of Creation Units by a Fund of Funds directly from a Fund will be accomplished in accordance with the policies of the Fund of Funds and will be based on the NAVs of the Funds.

Section 6(c) of the Act permits the Commission to exempt any persons or transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds that (a) the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.

Applicants request an order that would allow Funds to operate as index-based exchange traded funds (“ETFs”).<ref id="fnd2e12903" idref="fnd2e12909" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref> Fund shares will be purchased and redeemed at their NAV in Creation Units (other than pursuant to a distribution reinvestment program), as described in the application. All orders to purchase Creation Units and all redemption requests will be placed by or through an “Authorized Participant”, which will have signed a participant agreement with the Distributor. Shares will be listed and traded individually on a national securities exchange, where share prices will be based on the current bid/offer market. Certain Funds may operate as Feeder Funds in a master-feeder structure. Any order granting the requested relief would be subject to the terms and conditions stated in the application.

Shares will be purchased and redeemed in Creation Units and generally on an in-kind basis, or issued in less than Creation Unit size to investors participating in a distribution reinvestment program. Except where the purchase or redemption will include cash under the limited circumstances specified in the application, purchasers will be required to purchase Creation Units by depositing specified instruments (“Deposit Instruments”), and shareholders redeeming their shares will receive specified instruments (“Redemption Instruments”). The Deposit Instruments and the Redemption Instruments will each correspond pro rata to the positions in the Fund's portfolio (including cash positions) except as specified in the application.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">4. Because shares will not be individually redeemable, applicants request an exemption from Section 5(a)(1) and Section 2(a)(32) of the Act that would permit the Funds to register as open-end management investment companies and issue shares that are redeemable in Creation Units (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment program).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">5. Applicants also request an exemption from section 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c–1 under the Act as secondary market trading in shares will take place at negotiated prices, not at a current offering price described in a Fund's prospectus, and not at a price based on NAV. Applicants state that (a) secondary market trading in shares does not involve a Fund as a party and will not result in dilution of an investment in shares, and (b) to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day, or from day to day, such variances occur as a result of third-party market forces, such as supply and demand. Therefore, applicants assert that secondary market transactions in shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers. Finally, applicants represent that share market prices will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities, which should prevent shares from trading at a material discount or premium from NAV.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">6. With respect to Funds that effect creations and redemptions of Creation Units in kind and that are based on certain Underlying Indexes that include foreign securities, applicants request relief from the requirement imposed by section 22(e) in order to allow such Funds to pay redemption proceeds within fifteen calendar days following the tender of Creation Units for redemption. Applicants assert that the requested relief would not be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of section 22(e) to prevent unreasonable, undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the actual payment of redemption proceeds.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">7. Applicants request an exemption to permit Funds of Funds to acquire Fund shares beyond the limits of section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act; and the Funds, and any principal underwriter for the Funds, and/or any broker or dealer registered under the Exchange Act, to sell shares to Funds of Funds beyond the limits of section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act. The application's terms and conditions are designed to, among other things, help prevent any potential (i) undue influence over a Fund through control or voting power, or in connection with certain services, transactions, and underwritings, (ii) excessive layering of fees, and (iii) overly complex fund structures, which are the concerns underlying the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">8. Applicants request an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act to permit persons that are Affiliated Persons, or Second Tier-Affiliates, of the Funds, solely by virtue of certain ownership interests, to effectuate purchases and redemptions in-kind. The deposit procedures for in-kind purchases of Creation Units and the redemption procedures for in-kind redemptions of Creation Units will be the same for all purchases and redemptions and Deposit Instrument and Redemption Instruments will be valued in the same manner as those investment positions currently held by the Funds. Applicants also seek relief from the prohibitions on affiliated transactions in section 17(a) to permit a Fund to sell its shares to and redeem its shares from a Fund of Funds, and to engage in the accompanying in-kind transactions with the Fund of Funds.<ref id="fnd2e12938" idref="fnd2e12944" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">3</ref> The purchase of Creation Units by a Fund of Funds directly from a Fund will be accomplished in accordance with the policies of the Fund of Funds and will be based on the NAVs of the Funds.

Applicants, moreover, are not seeking relief from section 17(a) for, and the requested relief will not apply to, transactions where a Fund could be deemed an Affiliated Person, or a Second-Tier Affiliate, of a Fund of Funds because an Adviser or an entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with an Adviser provides investment advisory services to that Fund of Funds.</p>

Applicants also request relief to permit a Feeder Fund to acquire shares of another registered investment company having substantially the same investment objectives as the Feeder Fund (“Master Fund”) beyond the limitations in section 12(d)(1)(A) and permit the Master Fund, and any principal underwriter for the Master Fund, to sell shares of the Master Fund to the Feeder Fund beyond the limitations in section 12(d)(1)(B).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">10. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the Commission to exempt any persons or transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds that (a) the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2002-05-15">May 15, 2002</date>, Congress enacted the “Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002,” now recognized as the No FEAR Act (<ref href="/us/pl/107/174">Pub. L. 107–174</ref>). One purpose of the Act is to “require that Federal agencies be accountable for violations of antidiscrimination and whistleblower protection laws.” (<ref href="/us/pl/107/174">Pub. L.  107–174</ref>, Summary). In support of this purpose, Congress found that “agencies cannot be run effectively if those agencies practice or tolerate discrimination” (<ref href="/us/pl/107/174/tI">Pub. L. 107–174, Title I</ref>, General Provisions, section 101(1)). The Act also requires the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) to provide this Notice to all USDOT employees, former USDOT employees, and applicants for USDOT employment. This Notice informs such individuals of the rights and protections available under Federal antidiscrimination and whistleblower protection laws.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Antidiscrimination Laws
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A Federal agency cannot discriminate against an employee or applicant with respect to the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status, genetic information, or political affiliation. One or more of the following statutes prohibit discrimination on these bases: <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s2302/b/1">5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1)</ref>, <ref href="/us/usc/t29/s631">29 U.S.C. 631</ref>, <ref href="/us/usc/t29/s633a">29 U.S.C. 633a</ref>, <ref href="/us/usc/t29/s206/d">29 U.S.C. 206(d)</ref>, <ref href="/us/usc/t29/s791">29 U.S.C. 791</ref>, <ref href="/us/usc/t42/s2000e–16">42 U.S.C. 2000e–16</ref> and 2000ff.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">If you believe you were a victim of unlawful discrimination on the bases of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, genetic information, and/or disability, you must contact an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselor within 45 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory action, or in the case of a personnel action, within 45 calendar days of the effective date of the action to try and resolve the matter informally. This must be done before filing a formal complaint of discrimination with USDOT (See, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> <ref href="/us/cfr/t29/p1614">29 CFR part 1614</ref>). If you believe you were a victim of unlawful discrimination based on age, you must either contact an EEO counselor as noted above or give notice of intent to sue to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 180 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory action. As an alternative to filing a complaint pursuant to <ref href="/us/cfr/t29/p1614">29 CFR part 1614</ref>, you can file a civil action in <?page num="46121"?>a United States district court under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, against the head of an alleged discriminating agency after giving the EEOC not less than a 30 day notice of the intent to file such action. You may file such notice in writing with the EEOC via mail at P.O. Box 77960, Washington, DC 20013, the EEOC Web site <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.eeoc.gov/employees/charge.cfm,</inline> personal delivery, or facsimile within 180 days of the occurrence of the alleged unlawful practice.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">If you are alleging discrimination based on marital status or political affiliation, you may file a written discrimination complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC). Form OSC–11 is available online at the OSC Web site <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">http://www.osc.gov,</inline> under the tab to file a complaint. Additionally, you can download the form from <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">http://www.osc.gov/Pages/Resources-OSCForms.aspx.</inline> Complete Form OSC–11 and mail it to the Complaints Examining Unit, U.S. Office of Special Counsel at 1730 M Street NW., Suite 218, Washington, DC 20036–4505. You also have the option to call the Complaints Examining Unit at (800) 872–9855 for additional assistance. In the alternative (or in some cases, in addition), you may pursue a discrimination complaint by filing a grievance through the USDOT administrative or negotiated grievance procedures, if such procedures apply and are available.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">If you are alleging compensation discrimination pursuant to the Equal Pay Act, and wish to pursue your allegations through the administrative process, you must contact an EEO counselor within 45 calendar days of the alleged discriminatory action as such complaints are processed under EEOC's regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t29/p1614">29 CFR part 1614</ref>. Alternatively, you may file a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction within two years, or if the violation is willful, three years of the date of the alleged violation, regardless of whether you pursued any administrative complaint processing. The filing of a complaint or appeal pursuant to <ref href="/us/cfr/t29/p1614">29 CFR part 1614</ref> shall not toll the time for filing a civil action.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under existing laws, USDOT retains the right, where appropriate, to discipline a USDOT employee who engages in conduct that is inconsistent with Federal Antidiscrimination and Whistleblower Protection laws up to and including removal from Federal service. If OSC initiates an investigation under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s1214">5 U.S.C. 1214</ref>, USDOT must seek approval from the Special Counsel to discipline employees for, among other activities, engaging in prohibited retaliation (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s1214">5 U.S.C. 1214</ref>). Nothing in the No FEAR Act alters existing laws, or permits an agency to take unfounded disciplinary action against a USDOT employee, or to violate the procedural rights of a USDOT employee accused of discrimination.
