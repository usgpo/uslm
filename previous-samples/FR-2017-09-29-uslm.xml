</heading>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">A. Background
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NCPC's 2004 Policies were adopted in 2004 (<ref href="/us/fr/69/41299">69 FR 41299</ref>, <date date="2004-07-08">July 8, 2004</date>) and generally remain appropriate. However certain portions of the 2004 Policies require revision to simplify, streamline, and improve the effectiveness of NCPC's process for complying with NEPA. Accordingly, this document adopts a complete new rule.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">B. Elimination of Section 106 Procedures
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">One of the most significant changes reflected in the new rule is the elimination of procedures for complying with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). In 2004, when it adopted the 2004 Policies, NCPC opted to issue combined NEPA and NHPA guidance to ensure coordinated implementation of both procedures. However, regulations promulgated by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) do not require agencies to adopt agency specific processes and procedures (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">see</inline> 36 CFR chapter VIII). Instead ACHP regulations establish the processes and procedures all Federal Agencies must follow. This resulted in the inclusion of duplicative information in NCPC's 2004 Policies. While this information proved helpful, it diverted attention away from NCPC's agency-specific NEPA procedures mandated by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). Accordingly, this rule does not include detailed references to the Section 106 consultation process. It does include a reference to coordination between NEPA and NHPA and consideration of historic resources in the NEPA process.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">C. Federal and Non-Federal Agencies
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">To clarify roles and responsibilities, these Regulations distinguish between Federal Agency applicants and Non-Federal Agency applicants. Federal Agency applicants include cabinet level departments and executive agencies such as the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). Non-Federal Agency applicants include, without limitation, the Smithsonian Institution, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the National Gallery of Art, the U.S. Institute of Peace, the Government of the District of Columbia, the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission (MNCPPC), and private parties and entities implementing projects on Federal land. NCPC's jurisdiction extends to Non-Federal Agency applicants when they undertake projects on federally-owned land. Under this rule, NCPC serves as the Lead Agency for Non-Federal Agency applications. This is necessitated by the fact the Non-Federal Agencies are not subject to NEPA. However, if the Commission takes an approval action on a Non-Federal Agency application, the requirements of NEPA apply to the Commission's decision-making process. This means NCPC must undertake the requisite steps of the NEPA process for a Non-Federal Agency application to meet its legal obligation.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">D. Timing and Sequencing of Submission of NEPA Documents
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">These Regulations also alter the timing and sequencing of an applicant's submission of NEPA documentation for applications governed by the National Capital Planning Act and the Commemorative Works Act. Under the 2004 Policies, an applicant was required to complete the NEPA process at the time of preliminary review. Under this rule, an applicant must complete its NEPA process at the time of final review. This revised approach allows the Commission an opportunity to provide input on a project when it is still in the developmental phase. It also provides a NEPA sequencing consistent with Federal Agency project development schedules. This eliminates the pressure on Federal Agency applicants to expedite its NEPA process to meet NCPC's current sequencing requirements.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">E. Categorical Exclusions
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NCPC's rule also includes changes to the list of projects eligible for application of a Categorical Exclusion (CATEX). The Regulations include several new CATEXs. NCPC eliminated several existing CATEXs because they were based on old, antiquated authorities which have little to no relationship to NCPC's present day review roles. The rule also increase the number of extraordinary circumstances which negate the application of a CATEX.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">II. Summary of and Response to Comments

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">A. General
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NCPC published a Proposed Rule (<ref href="/us/fr/82/42570">82 FR 42570</ref>, <date date="2017-05-30">May 30, 2017</date>) addressing revisions to its 2004 Policies, establishing a 45-day public comment period. The public comment period closed on <date date="2017-07-14">July 14, 2017</date>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NCPC received a little under 100 comments on its proposed NEPA rule Regulations. Comments were submitted by the General Services Administration, the U.S. Department of the Interior and it's National Park Service, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the Smithsonian Institution; the Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority; the National Trust for Historic Preservation; The Committee of 100 on the Federal City; approximately 21 members of the general public; and two private consulting firms. A summary chart of all the comments received and NCPC's response thereto can be found on NCPC's Web site at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">www.ncpc.gov</inline>/subnepa.

<?page num="45422"?></p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The major comments can be grouped into six categories: (1) The elimination of detailed reference to compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA; (2) the treatment of Non-Federal Agencies in the Regulations; (3) the timing and sequencing of submitting NEPA Documents/Co-Signing a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or a Record of Decision (ROD); (4) NCPC's reliance on the CATEX of other government agencies; and (5) the minimal focus on public participation in the NEPA process/lack of public knowledge of process for administering CATEXs.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">B. Revised Name for the Regulations
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NCPC decided to rename its NEPA requirements the National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (Regulations). This title is more descriptive of the true nature of the Regulations versus the title of Environmental Policies and Procedures conferred on the 2004 Policies.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">C. Elimination of NHPA Section 106 Requirements
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Several comments addressed the elimination of NHPA Section 106 procedures from the Regulations. The National Trust for Historic Preservation generally agreed with the elimination, but it suggested designating the NEPA Lead and Cooperating Agencies as the Lead and Consulting Parties for the Section 106 process. NCPC disagrees with this suggestion. NCPC maintains it is inappropriate to designate roles for the Section 106 process in its NEPA Regulations. To compensate for the elimination, a member of the public suggested reference to ACHP guidance on the ACHP for integrating NEPA and the Section 106 processes. While NCPC found merit to this comment and initially inserted an endnote to the ACHP Web site and the CEQ Web site for general NEPA guidance, CEQ believed the references unnecessary. Finally, the Committee of 100 on the Federal City maintained the elimination of references to the Section 106 process sent a negative message about the connection between the two processes. NCPC notes this was not its intention as evidenced by the clearly articulated policy in § 601.2(d) to integrate the requirements of NEPA with, among others, the requirements of the NHPA.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">D. Role of Non-Federal Agencies
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The role of Non-Federal Agencies in the NEPA process generated a number of comments. The Smithsonian Institution (designated a Non-Federal Agency in the Regulations) recommended the re-designation of Federal and Non-Federal Agencies as Executive and Non-Executive Agencies on the theory that this might be less confusing. NCPC declined to make this change because of the repeated use of the term “federal” in the National Capital Planning Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t40/s8701">40 U.S.C. 8701</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.</inline>). However, for clarification purposes, NCPC revised the definition of Non-Federal Agencies to indicate this designation applies only for purposes of NEPA.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">One member of the public challenged the legality of designating Non-Federal Agencies as “Cooperating Agencies” given that the CEQ regulatory definition only designates “federal agencies” as capable of serving in this capacity. NCPC notes this statement is only partially correct. The definition of Cooperating Agency in <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s1508.5">40 CFR 1508.5</ref> also extends to state or local agencies rendering such agencies eligible to serve as Cooperating Agencies. This makes Cooperating Agency status appropriate for the Government of the District of Columbia and the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission. As to the others listed in the definition—Smithsonian Institution, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the National Gallery of Art, the U.S. Institute of Peace, and private parties undertaking development on Federal land—NCPC agrees an alternative approach is necessary.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NCPC also agrees with the same individual's multiple comments that NCPC does not undertake NEPA “on behalf” of Non-Federal Agencies. NCPC recognizes that the NEPA obligation for a Non-Federal Agency application belongs to NCPC. NCPC believes a minor wording change to “undertakes NEPA for a Non-Federal Agency application” solves this concern.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Turning to an alternative approach for NEPA compliance for Non-Federal Agency applications, NCPC notes it is not alone in confronting the issue of Non-Federal Agency applications to which NEPA applies because of the Federal Agency's approval/permitting authority. NCPC looked at the NEPA regulations for similarly situated Federal Agencies to ascertain how they handle the issue. One Federal Agency lists in its regulations the information that the Non-Federal Agency (permittee and owner of the project) must submit to facilitate staff's preparation of the requisite NEPA document. Because this approach increased the complexity of the agency's regulations, and NCPC's goal is to streamline its regulations consistent with the Administration's articulated regulatory reduction goals, NCPC adopted a modified version of this approach.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NCPC will enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) (renamed from a Memorandum of Understanding or MOU in the proposed rule) with Non-Federal Agencies. The MOA will specify, among others, the information the Non-Federal Agency must submit to enable preparation of the requisite environmental document by NCPC staff and the timing of the information's submission. Contrary to the comments on one individual, NCPC disagrees the MOA approach is legally insufficient. This comment implies NCPC is relinquishing its NEPA responsibilities by entering into a MOA. This is not the case. NCPC considers the MOA an internal operating procedure within its authority to implement. It is also an efficient and effective way to fulfill its NEPA obligation and avoid some of the pitfalls associated with the prior approach of Cooperating Agency status. The problems avoided include budgetary issues if the Non-Federal Agency provides money to NCPC to retain a contractor, Non-Federal Agency participation in NCPC's retention of the Non-Federal Agency funded contractor, and the potential for two A&amp;E contractors working on different aspects of the same project. To facilitate public awareness, NCPC will post the completed MOA on the NCPC's Web site.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NCPC notes that in a follow-up conversation with the commenter to explore the rationale for opposing an MOA, the commenter agreed the MOA approach as outlined above is legally sufficient. NCPC conducted the follow-up conversation after the comment period closed, and no new comments were discussed during the conversation.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">E. Timing and Sequencing of Submitting NEPA Documents/Co-Signing FONSIs and RODs
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">All the government agencies supported NCPC's process change of moving NEPA completion to coincide with the Commission's final approval. There was one concern expressed about the sequencing of NEPA and the Commemorative Works Act's review process, but NCPC believes the comment was the result of a misunderstanding of the process.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Multiple Federal Agencies also advised against incorporation of a provision allowing NCPC to co-sign another agency's FONSI or ROD. NCPC notes that the Regulations render this practice discretionary. However, if both agencies agree on the contents of a FONSI or ROD, it makes no sense for NCPC to prepare a duplicated document for NCPC to sign. Obviously, if the two agencies have different reasons for <?page num="45423"?>reaching a FONSI or a ROD, co-signature is not an option, and each agency will have to prepare its own document. Co-signature is also not an option if there is disagreement over the ability to reach a FONSI or ROD. This disagreement points to problems with the Environmental Document that must be resolved before the project can be presented to the Commission. Finally, NCPC reminds Federal Agencies that co-signing a FONSI or ROD is entirely consistent with the Administration's efforts to streamline regulatory processes especially NEPA.



 </p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">F. Use of Another Agency's CATEX
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The inclusion of five Categorical Exclusions that allowed NCPC to use the exclusion of another agency when it had no corresponding CATEX generated a number of comments pro and con. Federal Agencies supported the concept because it removed the possible need for them to prepare an EA if they used a Categorical Exclusions for their project but NCPC had no exclusion it could apply. The National Trust for Historic preservation and a member of the general public objected to the approach noting it was inconsistent with CEQ's long standing policy to disallow such an approach.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As required, NCPC submitted an administrative record to CEQ for all of its proposed CATEX, most of which are carry-overs from several iterations of prior regulations. The administrative record noted that the five CATEXs predicated upon use of another agency's exclusion had not been enlarged in scope and the CATEX continued to be appropriately limited by extraordinary circumstances, the number of which has been significantly increased in the Regulations.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NCPC's Administrative Record for the five CATEXs at issue was initially accepted, but upon further reflection CEQ has decided to adhere to its long standing policy to disallow such an approach. Consequently, NCPC has removed all five of the CATEXs at issue. Since four of the five CATEX at issue have been put to little use for a prolonged period of time, NCPC does not believe its implementation of NEPA will be unduly burdened by this removal. The addition of new CATEX may also fill the gap.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">G. Public Participation/Public Knowledge of Process for Administering CATEX
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Committee of 100 on the Federal City commented on the silence of the proposed regulation on the goals, criteria and process for meaningful public participation. They encouraged the incorporation of meaningful public participation policy and goals to rectify this deficiency.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NCPC is fully committed to open government and transparency and believes its past actions amply substantiate this commitment not only in the NEPA and Section 106 processes but to all of its significant planning activities. Accordingly, the Regulations clearly articulate a policy of using the NEPA process to “. . . foster meaningful public involvement in NCPC's decisions.” Moreover, throughout the Regulations, there are repeated opportunities for public participation to include in the EIS scoping process with an option for NCPC to conduct a public scoping process for Environmental Assessments as well; in the review of draft Environmental Assessments (EAs) (at NCPC's option) and Environmental Impact Statements (EISs); and in the review of FONSIs and RODs. Moreover, at the suggestion of another commenter, documents required to be published in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> (Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS and Notice of Availability of an EIS) will also be published on the NCPC Web site where parties interested in NCPC activities are more likely to go to stay abreast of current NCPC events.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Committee of 100 on the Federal City also expressed concern about the Regulation's silence on the administrative process for the application of a CATEX. NCPC notes that among the Commission's official delegations is one conferring administrative responsibility for NEPA on the Executive Director. In the future, owing to the recent redesign of NCPC's Web site, the delegations will be listed on the Web site. However, NCPC notes this responsibility, how and when it is made, and how the public is notified of the decision is set forth in §§ 601.11(c) and 601.12(b) of the Regulations.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">H. CEQ Comments
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As required by CEQ Regulations, NCPC submitted a draft of this final rule to CEQ for its review and approval following revisions to the Regulations to reflect comments received during the public comment period. CEQ responded with a number of recommendations. Most of the recommendations were minor in nature and involved language clarifications, addition of cross-references to relevant sections of CEQ's regulations, and inclusion of additional language.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The one recommendation falling outside the minor category related to the timing of the signing FONSIs and RODs by Federal Agency applicants and NCPC for Non-Federal Agency applications. NCPC has in the past accepted signed FONSIs and RODs at the time an application for final approval is submitted to the Commission. This practice reflects the close coordination between NCPC and its applicants and the likelihood that the Commission, with rare exceptions, will approve the final application. CEQ (and one commenter) pointed out that notwithstanding the high probability the signed FONSI or ROD would reflect the Commission's decision, it was technically incorrect. The signature of a FONSI or ROD can only occur after the Commission takes a final action and cannot precede a future, anticipated decision of approval.
</p>

The Federal Agency applicant may pursue, among others, the option of revising the project in a manner responsive to the Commission's comments. If the Federal Agency pursues this option, it shall review and consider the need for possible changes to its Environmental Document and its FONSI or ROD. Upon resubmission of a revised application for final review, the applicant shall submit a revised Environmental Document and a revised FONSI or ROD if in its judgement revised documents are necessary. If NCPC and the applicant disagree regarding the need for a revised Environmental Document and FONSI or ROD, the parties shall work together to resolve their differences. The final decision regarding the need for a revised Environmental Document and a revised FONSI or ROD shall be made by the Commission's Executive Committee.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 38.1051 of the Commission's regulations, <ref href="/us/cfr/t17/s38.1051">17 CFR 38.1051</ref>, governs the system safeguards requirements for DCMs. Pursuant to § 38.1051(n), DCMs are required to provide the Commission with their annual total trading volume by January 31 each calendar year. Section 38.1051(n)(2) also requires the Commission to provide each DCM with their percentage of the combined annual total trading volume among all DCMs regulated by the Commission by February 28 each calendar year. This annual Commission notification informs each DCM whether it is a “covered DCM” as that term is defined in § 38.1051(h)(1). A covered DCM is a DCM whose annual trading volume in a given year is five percent or more of the combined annual trading volume of all DCMs regulated by the Commission. Covered DCMs are required to comply with enhanced requirements with respect to the frequency of cybersecurity testing and the use of independent contractors. The Commission is amending § 38.1051 by adding paragraph (n)(3) to delegate authority to the Director of the Division of Market Oversight and designated staff to notify DCMs of their annual trading volume percentage.

Opioid-induced constipation is caused by an activation of mu-opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. Naldemedine, a peripheral acting mu-opioid antagonist, can prevent OIC.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In making the determination to make this rule effective immediately, the DEA took into consideration the effects of immediate implementation. The DEA agrees that making this rule immediately effective is in the best interest of the public health and will not burden registrants, the healthcare system or law enforcement. The DEA notes that its decision to make this rule effective immediately aligns with the exceptions to the 30-day effective date requirement of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). One of the APA's exceptions to the 30-day effective date is for a substantive rule granting or recognizing an exemption or which relieves a restriction. <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/d/1">5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1)</ref>.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Administrator, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s601–612">5 U.S.C. 601–612</ref>) (RFA), has reviewed this rule and by approving it certifies that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The purpose of this rule is to remove naldemedine from the list of schedules of the CSA. This action removes regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to controlled substances for handlers and proposed handlers of naldemedine. Accordingly, it has the potential for some economic impact in the form of cost savings.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This rule will affect all persons who handle, or propose to handle, naldemedine. Due to the wide variety of unidentifiable and unquantifiable variables that potentially could influence handling of naldemedine, the DEA is unable to determine the number of entities and small entities which might handle naldemedine. However, the DEA estimates that all persons who handle, or propose to handle naldemedine, are currently registered with the DEA to handle controlled substances. Therefore, the 1.7 million (1,683,023 as of April 2017) controlled substance registrations, representing approximately 436,761 entities, would be the maximum number of entities affected by this rule. The DEA estimates that 425,856 (97.5%) of 436,761 affected entities are “small entities” in accordance with the RFA and Small Business Administration size standards.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The DEA estimates all controlled substance registrants handle both controlled and non-controlled substances and these registrants are expected to continue to handle naldemedine. Additionally, since prospective naldemedine handlers are likely to handle other controlled substances, the cost benefits they would receive as a result of the de-control of naldemedine is minimal. As naldemedine handlers continue to handle other controlled substances, they will need to maintain their DEA registration and keep the same security and recordkeeping processes, equipment, and facilities in place and would experience only minimal reduction in security, inventory, recordkeeping, and labeling costs. Physical security control requirements are the same for controlled substances listed in schedules II, III, IV, and V for the vast majority of registrants (practitioners).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">While the DEA does not have a basis to estimate the number of affected entities, the DEA estimates that the maximum number of affected entities is 436,761 of which 425,856 are estimated to be small entities. Since the affected entities are expected to handle other controlled substances and maintain security and recordkeeping facilities and processes consistent with controlled substances, the DEA estimates any economic impact will be minimal. Because of these facts, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The law makes significant changes to the TRICARE program, especially to the health maintenance organization (HMO)-like health plan, known as TRICARE Prime; to the preferred provider organization (PPO) health plan, previously called TRICARE Extra which is to be replaced <?page num="45439"?>by TRICARE Select; and to the third health care option, known as TRICARE Standard, which will be terminated as of <date date="2017-12-31">December 31, 2017</date>, and also replaced by TRICARE Select. The statute also adopts a new health plan enrollment system under TRICARE and new provisions for access to care, high value services, preventive care, and healthy lifestyles. In implementing the statutory changes, this interim final rule makes a number of improvements to TRICARE.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In implementing section 701 and partially implementing several other sections of NDAA–17, this interim final rule advances all four components of the Military Health System's quadruple aim of improved readiness, better care, better health, and lower cost. The aim of improved readiness is served by reinforcing the vital role of the TRICARE Prime health plan to refer patients, particularly those needing specialty care, to military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in order to ensure that military health care providers maintain clinical currency and proficiency in their professional fields. The objective of better care is enhanced by a number of improvements in beneficiary access to health care services, including increased geographical coverage for the TRICARE Select provider network, reduced administrative hurdles for TRICARE Prime enrollees to obtain urgent care services and specialty care referrals, and promotion of high value services and medications. The goal of better health is advanced by expanding TRICARE coverage of preventive care services, treatment of obesity, high-value care, and telehealth. And the aim of lower cost is furthered by refining cost-benefit assessments for TRICARE plan specifications that remain under DoD's discretion and adding flexibilities to incentivize high-value health care services.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This interim final rule is required to implement or partially implement several sections of NDAA–17, including 701, 706, 715, 718, and 729. The legal authority for this rule also includes <ref href="/us/usc/t10/ch55">chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code</ref>.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The major provisions of the interim final rule are:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">➢ The establishment of TRICARE Select as a self-managed, PPO option under the TRICARE program. TRICARE Select replaces the TRICARE Extra and Standard programs and adopts a number of improvements, including fixed copayments rather than cost shares for covered benefits provided by a civilian network provider. TRICARE Select beneficiaries can choose any provider for their healthcare; however, they will enjoy lower out-of-pocket costs if they choose preferred providers within the TRICARE civilian network.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">➢ The continuation of TRICARE Prime as a managed care, HMO-like option under the TRICARE program. TRICARE Prime adopts a number of changes to conform to specifications in the new law, including categories of health care services applicable to the determination of copayment amounts (such as primary care, specialty care, emergency care).






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">➢ Improved access to care, including a codified requirement that the TRICARE Select health care plan is available in all locations and at least 85% of the U.S. beneficiary TRICARE Select population is covered by the TRICARE network. Also, for TRICARE Prime enrollees, there are new procedures to ensure timely appointments for health care services and to authorize some or all urgent care visits without the need for referral from a primary care manager.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">➢ Promotion of high value services and medications, telehealth services, preventive health care, and healthy lifestyles.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">➢ A new design for the health care enrollment system, including mandatory enrollment to maintain TRICARE coverage, an annual open season enrollment period, and hassle-free enrollment procedures.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">➢ Other features include preservation of benefits for active duty dependents and TRICARE-for-Life beneficiaries, and changes to the TRICARE Young Adult (TYA), TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS), TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR), Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP), and TRICARE Retiree Dental Program (TRDP) to conform with new statutory requirements.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">II. Provisions of Interim Final Rule
</heading>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">A. Establishment of TRICARE Select
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The rule implements the new law (section 701 of NDAA–17) that establishes TRICARE Select as a self-managed, PPO program. It allows beneficiaries to use the TRICARE civilian provider network, with reduced out-of-pocket costs compared to care from non-network providers, as well as military treatment facilities (when space is available). Similar to the long-operating “TRICARE Extra” and “TRICARE Standard” plans, which TRICARE Select replaces, a major feature is that enrollees will not have restrictions on their freedom of choice with respect to health care providers. TRICARE Select is based primarily on <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1075">10 U.S.C. 1075</ref> (as added by section 701 of NDAA–17) and <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1097">10 U.S.C. 1097</ref>. With respect to beneficiary cost sharing, the statute introduces a new split of beneficiaries into two groups: One group (which the rule refers to as “Group A”) consists of sponsors and their family members who first became affiliated with the military through enlistment or appointment before <date date="2018-01-01">January 1, 2018</date>, and the second group (referred to as “Group B”) who first became affiliated on or after <date date="2018-01-01">January 1, 2018</date>. In general, beneficiary out-of-pocket costs for Group B are higher than for Group A.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition to implementing the statutory specifications, the interim final rule also makes improvements for TRICARE Select Group A enrollees, compared to the features of the old TRICARE Extra plan. One such improvement is to convert the current cost-sharing requirement of 15% for active duty family members and 20% for retirees and their family members of the allowable charge for care from a network provider to a fixed dollar <?page num="45440"?>copayment calculated to approximately equal 15% or 20% of the average allowable charge for the category of care involved. Consistent with prevailing private sector health program practices, the fixed dollar copayment is more predictable for the patient and easier for the network health care provider to administer. The breakdown of categories of care (such as outpatient primary care visit, specialty care visit, emergency room visit, etc.) contained in the rule is the same as the categories now specified in the statute for Group B Select enrollees.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A second improvement in TRICARE Select (for both Group A and Group B) is that additional preventive care services that previously were only offered to TRICARE Prime beneficiaries will now (under the authority of <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1097">10 U.S.C. 1097</ref> and NDAA–17) also be covered for Select enrollees when furnished by a network health care provider. These are services recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the Health Resources and Services Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">These improvements are based partly on the statutory provision (<ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1075/c/2">10 U.S.C. 1075(c)(2)</ref>) that Group A Select enrollee cost-sharing requirements are calculated as if TRICARE Extra were still being carried out by DoD. TRICARE Extra specifications are based on the underlying authority of <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1097">10 U.S.C. 1097</ref>, which allows DoD to adopt special rules for the PPO plan. This statute was the basis for the original set of rules for TRICARE Extra, which were adopted in 1995, and is the authority for these improved rules for TRICARE Select Group A, adopted as if TRICARE Extra were still being carried out by DoD.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under the interim final rule, the cost sharing rules applicable to TRICARE Select Group B are those specified in <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1075">10 U.S.C. 1075</ref>. For TRICARE Select Group A, in addition to the copayment rules noted above, consistent with <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1075">10 U.S.C. 1075</ref>, an enrollment fee of $150 per person or $300 per family will begin <date date="2021-01-01">January 1, 2021</date>, for most retiree families, with annual updates thereafter based on the cost of living adjustment (COLA) applied to retired pay. At the same time, the catastrophic cap will increase from $3,000 to $3,500 for these retiree families. These changes, however, will not apply to TRICARE Select Group A active duty families, survivors of members who died while on active duty, or disability retiree families; that is, no enrollment fee will be applicable to this group and the applicable catastrophic cap will continue to be $1,000 for active duty families as established under <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1079/b">10 U.S.C. 1079(b)</ref> and $3,000 for survivors of members who died while on active duty or disability retiree families as established under <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1086/b">10 U.S.C. 1086(b)</ref>.

</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">B. Continuation of TRICARE Prime
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A second major feature of this interim final rule, based primarily on <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1075a">10 U.S.C. 1075a</ref> (also added by section 701 of NDAA–17), is the continuation of TRICARE Prime as a managed care, HMO-like program. It generally features use of military treatment facilities (MTFs) and substantially reduced out-of-pocket costs for authorized care provided outside MTFs. Beneficiaries generally agree to use military treatment facilities and designated civilian provider networks and to follow certain managed care rules and procedures. Like with TRICARE Select, with respect to beneficiary cost sharing, the statute introduces a new split of beneficiaries into two groups (again referred to in the rule as Group A and Group B) based on the military sponsor's initial enlistment or appointment before <date date="2018-01-01">January 1, 2018</date> (Group A), or on or after that date (Group B). Beneficiary cost sharing for Group B is slightly higher than for Group A.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As with TRICARE Select, the cost sharing specifications for TRICARE Prime Group B are set forth in the statute, and those for Group A are calculated in accordance with other health care provisions of title 10 (rather than the new section 1075a). The primary original statutory authority for the TRICARE Prime health plan, established by DoD regulation in 1995, was <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1097">10 U.S.C. 1097</ref>, and this continues to be relied upon for the continued operation of TRICARE Prime for Group A. Also relevant to the original terms of TRICARE Prime was section 731 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. That law required DoD to include, to the maximum extent practicable, the HMO-like option under TRICARE. That law also required that the HMO-like option “shall be administered so that the costs incurred by the Secretary under the TRICARE program are no greater than the costs that would otherwise be incurred”, to provide health care to beneficiaries. The extent to which this “cost neutrality” requirement has not been maintained was recently highlighted by the Congressional Budget Office: “CBO estimates that under current law, a typical retiree household enrolled in TRICARE Prime as a `family' in 2018, and for whom TRICARE is the primary payer of health benefits, will cost DoD about $17,400, and a typical family that uses Standard/Extra will cost DoD about $12,700.” <ref id="fnd4e2144" idref="fnd4e2150" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref>

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Based on the TRICARE Prime cost neutrality provision in NDAA–1994, the original 1995 TRICARE Prime regulation included (at <ref href="/us/cfr/t32/s199.18/g">32 CFR 199.18(g)</ref>) that cost sharing requirements “may be updated for subsequent years to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with statutory requirements pertaining to government costs.” Since NDAA–1994, Congress took away DoD's discretion for enrollment fee increases, which are now tied by law to the retired pay COLA. However, DoD continues to have discretion to update copayment amounts—which have not changed since 1995—and this discretion is confirmed by the newly enacted <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1075a/a/3">10 U.S.C. 1075a(a)(3)</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This discretion to update copayment amounts is continued in the interim final rule, but the framework for setting Prime Group A copayment amounts is being revised. Specifically, DoD is adopting for Group A the same structure of categories of care that Congress adopted for Group B. Thus, for example, while the current TRICARE Prime copayment amount makes no distinction between primary care and specialty care services, the new Group B structure under the statute does have a different copayment for primary care and specialty care. Under the rule, copayment amounts for Group A beneficiaries will be set for each of those categories, as well as the other categories of care the statute now specifies for Group B enrollees. The interim final rule does not specify the amount for each category of care. Rather, consistent with DoD's discretion under current statute and regulation, the actual amount will be set each year prior to open season enrollment. The interim final rule does, however, specify that the amount for each category of care for Group A enrollees may not exceed the amount that Congress set for Group B enrollees. In this way, the Prime copay structure would be in alignment with proposed legislative changes recommended by the Department to Congress for enactment this year to eliminate the “grandfathering” of Group A retiree families and return to a single TRICARE Prime model for all working-age retiree families. Again, it should be noted that this applies only to per-service copayments; enrollment fee increases for Group A enrollees will continue to be based on the retired pay COLA.

<?page num="45441"?></p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The interim final rule also continues the point-of-service provision of the current TRICARE Prime plan. Any health care services obtained by a Prime enrollee not in accordance with the rules and procedures of Prime (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.</inline> failure to obtain a primary care manager referral when such a referral is required or seeing a non-network provider when a network provider is available) will not be paid for under Prime rules, but may be covered by the point-of-service option. This results in higher cost sharing—specifically, a deductible of $300 per person and $600 per family, and a copayment of 50 percent of the allowable charges after the deductible. Point-of-service charges do not count against the annual catastrophic cap. These point-of-service rules continue for TRICARE Prime Group A and are also applicable to Group B. For Group B, the rules for point-of-service charges are specified in <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1075a/c">10 U.S.C. 1075a(c)</ref>, which clarifies that point-of-service cost sharing is “notwithstanding” the usual cost sharing rules of Prime Group B enrollees.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">One other matter on which the interim final rule preserves DoD discretion, similar to that in the current regulation, is with respect to the locations where TRICARE Prime is offered. This is noted in the current regulation at <ref href="/us/cfr/t32/s199.17/a/5">32 CFR 199.17(a)(5)</ref>. Under the interim final rule, the locations where TRICARE Prime will be offered will be determined by the Director, Defense Health Agency (DHA) and announced prior to the annual open season enrollment period. The guiding principle for this decision is that the purpose of TRICARE Prime is to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and the readiness of medical personnel. Codification in regulation of this guiding principle is a corollary to the codification by Congress in statute, specifically sections 703 and 725 of NDAA–17 that MTFs exist to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and the readiness of medical personnel.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">TRICARE Prime, especially for working age retirees and family members, provides MTFs clinical workload, including for a range of medical specialty areas that permit military health care providers to maintain currency and proficiency in their respective clinical fields. This important support of a ready medical force is what justifies the higher government cost of Prime (which CBO estimates at $17,400 per retiree family), notwithstanding the original statutory requirement of cost neutrality between TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Standard. This cost-benefit assessment supports the conclusion that it is practicable to offer TRICARE Prime in areas where it supports the medical readiness of one or more MTFs. Additionally, where TRICARE Prime is offered, it may be limited to active duty family members if the Director, DHA determines it is not practicable to offer TRICARE Prime to retired beneficiaries as well—a determination that again would take into account the nature of the supported MTF and the range of services it offers.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">C. Improved Access to Care
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A third significant change in the interim final rule is a set of improvements in standards for access to care. The TRICARE Select plan replaces TRICARE Standard as the generally applicable plan in all areas. Under TRICARE Select, eligible beneficiaries can choose any provider for their healthcare, and they will enjoy lower out-of-pocket costs if they choose providers within the TRICARE civilian network. The vast majority of TRICARE beneficiaries located in the United States will have access to TRICARE network providers (it is DoD's plan that at least 85% of the U.S. beneficiary population under TRICARE Select will be covered by the network upon implementation), similar to the current TRICARE Extra option, but with the benefit of predictable fixed dollar copayments. In cases in which a network provider is not available to a TRICARE Select enrollee, such as in remote locations where there are very few primary or specialty providers, enrollees will still have access to any TRICARE authorized provider, with cost sharing comparable to the current TRICARE Standard plan (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.</inline> 25% for retired category beneficiaries).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A second interim final rule enhancement for access to care is that if a TRICARE Prime enrollee seeks to obtain an appointment for care from the managed care support contractor but is not offered an appointment within the applicable access time standards from a network provider, the enrollee will be authorized to receive care from any authorized provider without incurring the additional fees associated with point-of-service care.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A third access to care improvement under the interim final rule is that the TRICARE Prime referral requirement may be waived for urgent care visits for Prime enrollees other than active duty members. This is similar to the current pilot program, which waives the referral requirement (other than for active duty members) for up to two urgent care visits per year. The specific number of urgent care visits without a referral will be determined annually prior to the beginning of the open season enrollment period.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A fourth access to care improvement is adoption of the new statutory provision that a primary care manager who believes a referral to a specialty care network provider is medically necessary and appropriate need not obtain pre-authorization from the managed care support contractor. Managed care support contractor preauthorization is only required with respect to a primary care manager's referral for inpatient hospitalization, inpatient care at a skilled nursing facility, inpatient care at a residential treatment center and inpatient care at a rehabilitation facility.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">D. Promotion of High Value Services and Medications and Telehealth Services
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition to the expansion noted above concerning preventive care services, the interim final rule makes a number of other improvements in TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select based on provisions of sections 701(h), 706, 718, and 729 of NDAA–17. Section 701(h), among other things, provides for a four-year pilot program to encourage use by patients of high value services and medications. Section 706, among other things, authorizes special arrangements with provider groups that will improve population-based health outcomes and focus more on preventive care. Section 729 calls for special actions to incentivize medical intervention programs to address chronic diseases and other conditions and healthy lifestyle interventions. Section 718, among other things, requires actions to promote greater use of telehealth services under TRICARE. While these sections of NDAA–17 also require actions outside the scope of this interim final rule (such as contracting actions) they can be partially implemented, consistent with Congressional intent, in this rule. The interim final rule does this in several ways.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">First, the interim final rule authorizes coverage under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select for medically necessary treatment of obesity even if it is the sole or major condition treated. Under <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1079/a/10">10 U.S.C. 1079(a)(10)</ref>, this is disallowed under the basic program. However, it is DoD's conclusion that the underlying authority of <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1097">10 U.S.C. 1097</ref>, together with section 729 of NDAA–17 (which specifically authorizes medical intervention for obesity), allow the Department to cover these services when provided by a network provider <?page num="45442"?>for a TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select enrollee.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Second, the interim final rule codifies authority of the Director, DHA to waive or reduce copayment requirements for TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select enrollees for care received from network providers for certain health care services that provide especially high value in terms of better health outcomes for patients. Authority for this includes section 706 and 729 of NDAA–17. This is also consistent with the four-year pilot program authority of section 701(h), but does not necessarily rely on that time-limited authority. Consistent with the intent of these sections, the Department also intends to use the authority of § 199.21(j)(3) of the TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program section of the TRICARE regulations to encourage use of high value medications by reducing or eliminating the copayment of selected medicines.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Third, consistent with section 718 of NDAA–17, the interim final rule provides that health care services covered by TRICARE and provided through the use of telehealth modalities are covered services to the same extent as if provided in person at the location of the patient if those services are medically necessary and appropriate for such modalities. The Director, DHA will establish standardized payment methods to reimburse for such services, and shall reduce or eliminate, as appropriate, beneficiary copayments or cost-shares for such services in cases in which a copayment would otherwise apply. This may be done by designating some telehealth services as high value services for which lower copays apply as well as the elimination of any beneficiary cost-sharing related to originating site fees when used to support the provision of telehealth services.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">E. Changes to Health Plan Enrollment System
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A fourth major change in the interim final rule is its implementation of the new statutory design for the health care enrollment system. Starting in calendar year 2018, beneficiaries other than active duty members and TRICARE-for-Life beneficiaries must elect to enroll in TRICARE Select or TRICARE Prime in order to be covered by the private sector care portion of TRICARE. While TRICARE-for-Life beneficiaries under the age of 65 are permitted to enroll in TRICARE Prime under limited circumstances, their failure to enroll will not affect their coverage by the private sector care portion of TRICARE. Enrollment will be done during an open season period prior to the beginning of each plan year, which operates with the calendar year. An enrollment choice will be effective for the plan year. As an exception to the open season enrollment rule, enrollment changes can be made during the plan year for certain qualifying events, such as a change in eligibility status, marriage, divorce, birth of a new family member, relocation, loss of other health insurance, or other events.   
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Eligible Prime or Select beneficiaries who do not enroll will no longer have private sector care coverage under the TRICARE program (including the TRICARE retail pharmacy and mail order pharmacy programs) until the next open enrollment season or they have a qualifying event, except that they do not lose any statutory eligibility for space-available care in military medical treatment facilities. There is a limited grace period exception to this enrollment requirement for calendar year 2018, as provided in section 701(d)(3) of NDAA–17, to give beneficiaries another chance to adjust to this new requirement for annual enrollment. For the administrative convenience of beneficiaries, there are also procedures for automatic enrollment in Prime and Select for most active duty family members, and automatic renewal of enrollments of covered beneficiaries, subject to the opportunity to decline or cancel.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Due to a compressed implementation schedule that precludes an annual open season enrollment period in calendar year 2017 for existing TRICARE beneficiaries to elect or change their TRICARE coverage, the Department will convert existing TRICARE Standard coverage to TRICARE Select coverage effective <date date="2018-01-01">January 1, 2018</date>. All other existing TRICARE coverages will be renewed effective <date date="2018-01-01">January 1, 2018</date>. As noted previously, beneficiaries may elect to change their TRICARE coverage anytime during the limited grace period in calendar year 2018.  
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">F. Additional Provisions of Interim Final Rule
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The interim final rule has several other noteworthy provisions. First, there are no changes in benefits for TRICARE-for-Life beneficiaries, or generally in cost sharing levels for active duty family members. Second, although “TRICARE Standard” is terminated as a distinct TRICARE plan as of <date date="2017-12-31">December 31, 2017</date>, basic program benefits (as established under <ref href="/us/cfr/t32/s199.4">32 CFR 199.4</ref>) continue under both TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select. In addition, when a TRICARE Select beneficiary receives services covered by the basic program benefits from an authorized health care provider who is not part of the TRICARE provider network, that care is covered by TRICARE as “out-of-network” care under terms that match the old TRICARE Standard plan. Third, in order to transition enrollment fees, deductibles, and catastrophic caps from a fiscal year basis to a calendar year basis, special rules apply for the last quarter of calendar year 2017, including that a Prime enrollee's enrollment fee for the quarter is one-fourth of the enrollment fee for fiscal year 2017, and the deductible amount and the catastrophic cap amount for fiscal year 2017 will be applicable to the 15-month period of <date date="2016-10-01">October 1, 2016</date>, through <date date="2017-12-31">December 31, 2017</date>. A similar transition rule will apply to TRICARE for Life, TYA, TRR and TRS to align remaining program deductibles and/or catastrophic caps from a fiscal year to calendar year basis for consistency and ease of administration.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Additionally, the interim final rule adopts several changes to regulatory provisions applicable to the TYA, TRS, TRR, and TRDP programs to conform with new statutory requirements. In implementing section 701(a) of NDAA–17, together with section 701(j)(1)(F), the rule conforms the TYA regulation to the statutory language which established the eligibility of TYA under <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1110b">10 U.S.C. 1110b</ref> to enroll in TRICARE Select and provided that the TYA premium shall apply instead of the otherwise applicable TRICARE Prime or Select enrollment fee. In implementing section 701(j)(1)(B), the rule conforms the TRICARE Reserve Select plan regulation to the statutory language which defines “TRICARE Reserve Select” as the TRICARE Select self-managed, preferred-provider network option under <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1075">10 U.S.C. 1075</ref> made available to beneficiaries under <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1076d">10 U.S.C. 1076d</ref> and requires payment of a premium for coverage instead of the TRICARE Select enrollment fee. In implementing section 701(j)(1)(C), the rule conforms the TRICARE Retired Reserve plan regulation to the statutory language which defines “TRICARE Retired Reserve” as the TRICARE Select self-managed, preferred-provider network option under <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1075">10 U.S.C. 1075</ref> made available to beneficiaries under <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1076e">10 U.S.C. 1076e</ref> and requires payment of a premium for coverage instead of the TRICARE Select enrollment fee. In implementing section 701(a) and 701(e), the rule conforms the CHCBP regulation to replace TRICARE Standard with TRICARE Select as the continuation health care benefit for Department of Defense and the other uniformed services beneficiaries losing eligibility. <?page num="45443"?>In implementing section 715, the rule conforms the TRDP regulation to the statutory language which authorizes an interagency agreement between the Department of Defense and the Office of Personnel Management to allow beneficiaries otherwise eligible for the TRDP to enroll in a dental insurance plan offered under the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. Under the statute, TRDP beneficiaries will have the opportunity to access a dental plan with significantly higher annual maximum benefit and a lower premium cost than available under the current TRDP, while giving the Department an opportunity to eliminate costs associated with procuring and administering a separate TRDP contract.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Also, the interim final rule adopts several changes to regulatory provisions applicable to benefit coverage of medically necessary food and vitamins. Section 714 of NDAA–17 confirms long-standing TRICARE policy authorizing benefit coverage of medically necessary vitamins when prescribed for management of a covered disease or condition. In addition, while section 714 confirms long-standing TRICARE policy authorizing medical nutritional therapy coverage of medically necessary food and medical equipment/supplies necessary to administer such food when prescribed for dietary management of a covered disease or condition, the law also allows the medically necessary food benefit to include coverage of low protein modified foods. Consistent with this we also recognize the role of Nutritionists and Registered Dieticians in the appropriate planning for the use of medically necessary foods.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Additionally, the interim final rule adopts several conforming changes to regulatory provisions applicable to general TRICARE administration, the TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program and the Extended Health Care Option to reflect transition of deductibles, catastrophic caps, and program reimbursement limitations, as applicable, from a fiscal year basis to a calendar year basis for consistency and ease of administration. Simultaneously, technical corrections are being made to the TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program to conform regulation provisions to statutory provisions enacted by section 702 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Finally, the interim final rule includes authority for the Director, DHA to establish preferred provider networks in areas outside the United States where it is determined to be economically in the best interests of the Department of Defense. As a result of the TRICARE Philippines Demonstration Project, which commenced in <date date="2013-01-01">January 1, 2013</date>, the Department has determined that the TRICARE contracted preferred provider network established in designated locations in the Philippines provided adequate access to beneficiaries with 97 percent of care delivered by network providers. It also successfully achieved the demonstration goals of reducing aberrant billing activities, reduced out-of-pocket expenses for beneficiaries, and increased overall beneficiary satisfaction while leading to a net savings to the government. Although the demonstration was projected to continue through <date date="2018-12-31">December 31, 2018</date>, the Philippines preferred provider network is determined to be economically in the interests of the Department of Defense and the demonstration shall terminate effective <date date="2017-12-31">December 31, 2017</date>, with transition of the demonstration's approved preferred provider network to a TRICARE Select preferred provider network effective <date date="2018-01-01">January 1, 2018</date>.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This is being issued as an interim final rule in order to comply with statutory specifications regarding effective dates of changes to TRICARE as a health care entitlement program. For example, the change from a fiscal year-based TRICARE plan year for purposes of enrollment fees, deductibles, and catastrophic caps to a calendar year-based TRICARE plan year requires that this regulation be in place by <date date="2017-10-01">October 1, 2017</date>. Many other changes <?page num="45445"?>must be in place by <date date="2018-01-01">January 1, 2018</date>, including the operation of TRICARE Select to replace TRICARE Extra and TRICARE Standard, which DoD no longer has authority to operate as of that date. In view of the statutory effective dates of the substantial changes in TRICARE, the Department finds that obtaining public comment in advance of issuing this rule is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. Nonetheless, DoD invites public comments on this rule and is committed to considering all comments and issuing a final rule as soon as practicable.

This interim final rule has been designated “significant regulatory action,” although not economically significant, under section 3(f) of <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>. Accordingly, this rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

This interim final rule is not an economically significant regulatory action, and it will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Such items must be related directly to an appropriate and verified covered medical condition of the specific beneficiary for whom the item was purchased and obtained from a medical supply company, a pharmacy, or authorized institutional provider. Examples of covered medical supplies and dressings are disposable syringes for a known diabetic, colostomy sets, irrigation sets, and elastic bandages. An external surgical garment specifically designed for use follow a mastectomy is considered a medical supply item.

                                                   <p> Actions to recover overpayments arise when the government has a right to recover money, funds, or property from any person, partnership, association, corporation, governmental body or other legal entity, foreign or domestic, except another Federal agency, because of an erroneous payment of benefits under both CHAMPUS and the TRICARE program under this part. The term “Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services” (CHAMPUS) is defined in <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1072/2">10 U.S.C. 1072(2)</ref>, referred to as the CHAMPUS basic program. Prior to <date date="2018-01-01">January 1, 2018</date>, the term “TRICARE program” referred to the triple-option of health benefits known as TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Extra, and TRICARE Standard. Specifically, TRICARE Standard was the TRICARE program under which the basic program of health care benefits generally referred to as CHAMPUS was made available to eligible beneficiaries under this Part 199. Effective <date date="2018-01-01">January 1, 2018</date>, the term “TRICARE program” is defined in <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1072/2">10 U.S.C. 1072(2)</ref> and includes TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select and TRICARE for Life. It is the purpose of this section to prescribe procedures for investigation, determination, assertion, collection, compromise, waiver and termination of claims in favor of the United States for erroneous benefit payments arising out of the administration CHAMPUS and the TRICARE program. For the purpose of this section, references herein to TRICARE beneficiaries, claims, benefits, <?page num="45448"?>payments, or appeals shall include CHAMPUS beneficiaries, claims, benefits, payments, or appeals. A claim against several joint debtors arising from a single incident or transaction is considered one claim. The Director, or a designee, may pursue collection against all joint debtors and is not required to allocate the burden of payment between debtors.

                                                   <content> The TRICARE program implements a number of improvements primarily through modernized managed care support contracts that include special arrangements with civilian sector health care providers and better coordination between military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) and these civilian providers to deliver an integrated, health care delivery system that provides beneficiaries with access to high quality healthcare. Implementation of these improvements, to include enhanced access, improved health outcomes, increased efficiencies and elimination of waste, in addition to improving and maintaining operational medical force readiness, includes adoption of special rules and procedures not ordinarily followed under CHAMPUS or MTF requirements. This section establishes those special rules and procedures.

This section provides that certain rules, procedures, rights and obligations set forth elsewhere in this part (and usually applicable to CHAMPUS) are different under the TRICARE program. To the extent that TRICARE program rules, procedures, rights and obligations set forth in this section are not different from or otherwise in conflict with those set forth elsewhere in this part as applicable to CHAMPUS, the CHAMPUS provisions are incorporated into the TRICARE program. In addition, some rules, procedures, rights and obligations relating to health care services in military treatment facilities are also different under the TRICARE program. In such cases, provisions of this section take precedence and are binding.

Therefore, not all provisions of this section are automatically implemented. Rather, implementation of the TRICARE program and this section requires an official action by the Director, Defense Health Agency. Public notice of the initiation of portions of the TRICARE program will be achieved through appropriate communication and media methods and by way of an official announcement by the Director identifying the military medical treatment facility catchment area or other geographical area covered.

It generally features use of military treatment facilities and substantially reduced out-of-pocket costs for care provided outside MTFs. Beneficiaries generally agree to use military treatment facilities and designated civilian provider networks and to follow certain managed care rules and procedures. The primary purpose of TRICARE Prime is to support the effective operation of an MTF, which exists to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and the readiness of medical personnel. TRICARE Prime will be offered in areas where the Director determines that it is appropriate to support the effective operation of one or more MTFs.

It allows beneficiaries to use the TRICARE provider civilian network, with reduced out-of-pocket costs compared to care from non-network providers, as well as military treatment facilities (where they exist and when space is available). TRICARE Select enrollees will not have restrictions on their freedom of choice with respect to authorized health care providers. However, when a TRICARE Select beneficiary receives services covered under the basic program from an authorized health care provider who is not part of the TRICARE provider network that care is covered by TRICARE but is subject to higher cost sharing amounts for “out-of-network” care. Those amounts are the same as under the basic program under § 199.4.

                                                      <content> The preemption of State and local laws set forth in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section includes State and local laws imposing premium taxes on health or dental insurance carriers or underwriters or other plan managers, or similar taxes on such entities. Such laws are laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods, within the meaning of the statutes identified in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section. Preemption, however, does not apply to taxes, fees, or other payments on net income or profit realized by such entities in the conduct of business relating to DoD health services contracts, if those taxes, fees or other payments are applicable to a broad range of business activity. For purposes of assessing the effect of Federal preemption of State and local taxes and fees in connection with DoD health and dental services contracts, interpretations shall be consistent with those applicable to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s8909/f">5 U.S.C. 8909(f)</ref>.

                                                   <content> TRICARE Prime is a managed care option that provides enhanced medical services to beneficiaries at reduced cost-sharing amounts for beneficiaries whose care is managed by a designated primary care manager and provided by an MTF or network provider. TRICARE Prime is offered in a location in which an MTF is located (other than a facility limited to members of the armed forces) that has been designated by the Director as a Prime Service Area. In addition, where TRICARE Prime is offered it may be limited to active duty family members if the Director determines it is not practicable to offer TRICARE Prime to retired category beneficiaries. TRICARE Prime is not offered in areas where the Director determines it is impracticable. If TRICARE Prime is not offered in a geographical area, certain active duty family members residing in the area may be eligible to enroll in TRICARE Prime Remote program under paragraph (g) of this section.

                                                   <content> TRICARE Select is the self-managed option under which beneficiaries may receive authorized basic program benefits from any TRICARE authorized provider. The TRICARE Select health care plan also provides enhanced program benefits to beneficiaries with access to a preferred-provider network with broad geographic availability within the United States at reduced out-of-pocket expenses. However, when a beneficiary receives services from an authorized health care provider who is not part of the TRICARE provider network, only basic program benefits (not enhanced Select care) are covered by TRICARE and the beneficiary is subject to higher cost sharing amounts for “out-of-network” care. Those amounts are the same as under the basic program under § 199.4.

A retiree or retiree family member who becomes eligible for Medicare Part A is not eligible to enroll in TRICARE Select; however, as provided in this paragraph (c), some Medicare eligible retirees/family members may be allowed to enroll in TRICARE Prime where available. In general, when a retiree or retiree family member becomes individually eligible for Medicare Part A and enrolls in Medicare Part B, he/she is automatically eligible for TRICARE-for-Life and is required to enroll in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) to verify eligibility. Further, some rules and procedures are different for dependents of active duty members and retirees, dependents, and survivors.

The higher point-of-service option cost sharing and deductible shall apply to specialty health care services received by any TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members enrollee unless an appropriate referral/preauthorization is obtained as required by paragraph (n) of this section under TRICARE Prime. In the case of pharmacy services under § 199.21, where the Director determines that no TRICARE network retail pharmacy has been established within a reasonable distance of the residence of the TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members enrollee, cost sharing applicable to TRICARE network retail pharmacies will be applicable to all CHAMPUS eligible pharmacies in the remote area.

When determined not to be practicable, as in the categories of care including ambulatory surgery, inpatient admissions, and inpatient skilled nursing/rehabilitation admissions, the calculated cost-sharing amounts are not converted to fixed dollar amounts. The fixed dollar amount for each category is set prospectively for each calendar year as the amount (rounded down to the nearest dollar amount) equal to 15% for enrollees in the active duty family beneficiary category or 20% for enrollees in the retired beneficiary category of the projected average allowable payment amount for each category of care during the year, as estimated by the Director.

The primary care manager may be part of the MTF or the Prime civilian provider network. The enrollee will be given the opportunity to register a preference for primary care manager from a list of choices provided by the Director. This preference will be entered on a TRICARE Prime enrollment form or similar document. Preference requests will be considered, but primary care manager assignments will be subject to availability under the MTF beneficiary category priority system under paragraph (d) of this section and subject to other operational requirements.

                                                         <content> For the purpose of this paragraph (n)(2), referral addresses the issue of who will provide authorized health care services. In many cases, Prime beneficiaries will be referred by a primary care manager to a medical department of an MTF if the type of care needed is available at the MTF. In such a case, failure to adhere to that referral will result in the care being subject to point-of-service charges. In other cases, a referral may be to the civilian provider network, and again, point-of-service charges would apply to a failure to follow the referral.

                                                         <content> In contrast to referral, preauthorization addresses the issue of whether particular services may be covered by TRICARE, including whether they appear necessary and appropriate in the context of the patient's diagnosis and circumstances. A major purpose of preauthorization is to prevent surprises about coverage determinations, which are sometimes dependent on particular details regarding the patient's condition and circumstances. While TRICARE Prime has referral requirements that do not exist for TRICARE Select, TRICARE Select has some preauthorization requirements that do not exist for TRICARE Prime.

Initial payment of the applicable enrollment fee shall be collected for new enrollments in accordance with established procedures. Any applicable enrollment fee will be pro-rated. A beneficiary who dis-enrolls without enrolling at the same time in another plan is not eligible to enroll in a plan later in the same plan year unless there is another qualifying event. A beneficiary who is dis-enrolled for failure to pay a required enrollment fee installment is not eligible to re-enroll in a plan later in the same plan year unless there is another qualifying event. Generally, the effective date of coverage will coincide with the date of the qualifying event.

                                                   <p> The CHCBP is a premium-based temporary health care coverage program, authorized by <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s1078a">10 U.S.C. 1078a</ref>, and available to individuals who meet the eligibility and enrollment criteria as set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The CHCBP is not part of the TRICARE program. However, as set forth in this section, it functions under similar rules and procedures to the TRICARE Select program. Because the purpose of the CHCBP is to provide a continuation health care benefit for Department of Defense and the other uniformed services beneficiaries losing eligibility, it will be administered so that it appears, to the maximum extent practicable, to be part of the TRICARE Select program. Medical coverage under this program will be the same as the benefits payable under the TRICARE Select program. There is a cost for enrollment to the CHCBP and these premium costs must be paid by CHCBP enrollees before any care may be cost shared.

                                                         <p> TYA coverage is a premium based program that an eligible young adult dependent may purchase. There is only individual coverage, and a premium shall be charged for each dependent even if there is more than one qualified dependent in the uniformed service sponsor's family that qualifies for TYA coverage. Dependents qualifying for TYA status can purchase individual TRICARE Select or TRICARE Prime coverage (as applicable) according to the rules governing the TRICARE option for which they are qualified on the basis of their uniformed service sponsor's TRICARE-eligible status (active duty, retired, Selected Reserve, or Retired Reserve) and the availability of a desired option in their geographic location. Premiums shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

                                                         <p> When their TYA coverage becomes effective, qualified beneficiaries receive the benefit of the TRICARE option that they selected, including, if applicable, access to military treatment facilities and pharmacies. TYA coverage features the cost share, deductible and catastrophic cap provisions applicable to Group B beneficiaries based on the program selected, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> the TRICARE Select program under § 199.17(l)(2)(ii) or the TRICARE Prime program under § 199.17(l)(ii), as well as the status of their military sponsor. Access to military treatment facilities under the system of access priorities in § 199.17(d)(1) is also based on the program selected as well as the status of the military sponsor. Premiums are not credited to deductibles or catastrophic caps; however, TYA premiums shall apply instead of any applicable TRICARE Prime or Select enrollment fee.

                                                   <p> Qualified young adult dependents are charged premiums for coverage under TYA that represent the full cost of the program, including reasonable administrative costs, as determined by the Director utilizing an appropriate actuarial basis for the provision of TRICARE benefits for the TYA-eligible beneficiary population. Separate premiums shall be established for TRICARE Select and Prime plans. There may also be separate premiums based on the uniformed services sponsor's status. Premiums are to be paid monthly, except as otherwise provided through administrative implementation, pursuant to procedures established by the Director. The monthly rate for each month of a calendar year is one-twelfth of the annual rate for that calendar year.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">II. Background Information and Regulatory History
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Coast Guard is extending, for an additional six months, an existing temporary safety zone for the navigable waters surrounding the entry of lava from the Kilauea Volcano into the Pacific Ocean on the southeast side of the Island of Hawaii, HI. Extending this safety zone ensures mariners remain safe from the potential hazards associated with molten lava entering the ocean while the proposed rule is being reviewed. This safety zone will continue to encompass all waters within 300 meters (984 feet) of all entry points of lava flow into the ocean. Because the entry points of the lava vary, the safety zone location will also vary. Entry of persons or vessels into this safety zone remains prohibited, unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Honolulu, or his designated representative.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Lava flow that enters the ocean can be potentially hazardous to anyone near it, particularly when lava deltas collapse. A lava delta is new land that forms when lava accumulates above sea level, and extends from the existing base of a sea cliff. Persons near active lava flow entry sites incur potential hazards, particularly when lava deltas collapse. These hazards include, but are not limited to, plumes of hot, corrosive seawater laden with hydrochloric acid, and fine volcanic particles that can irritate the skin, eyes, and lungs; explosions of debris and eruptions of scalding water from hot rock entering the ocean; sudden lava delta collapses; and waves associated with these explosions and collapses.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Lava has been entering the ocean at the Kamokuna lava delta on Kilauea Volcano's south coast since July 2016. On <date date="2016-12-31">December 31, 2016</date>, a large portion of lava delta collapsed into the ocean at the Kamokuna entry point. Following this collapse, portions of the adjacent sea cliff fell into the ocean, producing localized waves, and showers of debris. As of March 2017, a new delta has begun to form at the Kamokuna ocean entry point. This lava delta continues to grow and collapse, and cracks parallel to the sea cliff surrounding it persist, indicating further collapses may occur with little or no warning.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2017-03-28">March 28, 2017</date>, the Coast Guard established a temporary final rule (TFR) and put into place a safety zone for mariners near lava entry points to address the hazards of the lava entering the ocean. The TFR discussed Sector Honolulu's review of nearly 30 years of delta collapse and ejecta distance observations from the Hawaii Volcano Observatory records. The TFR was published in the <date date="2017-04-03">April 3, 2017</date> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> (<ref href="/us/fr/82/16109">82 FR 16109</ref>).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2017-04-03">April 3, 2017</date>, the Coast Guard also published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to establish a permanent safety zone that would encompass all waters extending 300 meters (984 feet) in every direction around all entry points of lava flow into the navigable waters surrounding the entry of lava from the Kilauea Volcano into the Pacific Ocean on the southeast side of the Island of Hawaii, HI (<ref href="/us/fr/82/16142">82 FR 16142</ref>). We determined that a radius of 300 meters was a reasonable, minimum high-hazard zone around a point of active lava flow entering the ocean. The safety zone allows the Coast Guard to impose and enforce restrictions on vessels operating closely to the lava entry area, which protects persons and vessels from the potential hazards associated with molten lava entering the ocean. The NPRM addressed this concern and invited the public to comment on the safety zone. The comment period, which ended on <date date="2017-06-02">June 2, 2017</date>, received 67 comments. On <date date="2017-05-08">May 8, 2017</date>, at a public meeting held in Hilo, HI, meeting participants discussed the proposed rule and NPRM's public comments.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">During the period of the TFR, four tour operators and one photographer with economic ties to lava tourism petitioned the COTP Honolulu for entry within 300 meters of the high-hazard zone. They also requested and petitioned for various levels of entry distances—ranging from a close, safe distance to 50 meters—based on sea conditions resulting from the lava entry. The COTP Honolulu granted express authorization for entry within 300 meters to the five operators. The authorization included operational restrictions and other vessel safety criteria requirements considered by the <?page num="45462"?>COTP Honolulu and will continue under the extended period of this TFR.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In order to review the overall impact of the final rule, a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) will be published, providing an additional 60 days for public comments and input. This TFR is necessary to promote navigational safety, provide for the safety of life and property, and facilitate the reasonable demands of commerce relating to tourism surrounding the lava entry points. It also provides an opportunity for further comment from the public. Upon publication of the SNPRM, we will invite additional public comments on this rulemaking.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/d/3">5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)</ref>, the Coast Guard finds good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>. Although we expect to review the SNPRM within 30 days of publication of this TFR, it would be impractical to delay the effective date of this rule. Immediate action is necessary to protect persons, vessels, and the public from the potential safety hazards associated with the ocean lava entry.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Coast Guard is issuing this rule under authority in <ref href="/us/usc/t33/s1231">33 U.S.C. 1231</ref>. The COTP Honolulu has determined that potential hazards associated with Kilauea's active lava flow entry into the Pacific Ocean on the southeast side of the Island of Hawaii, HI is a safety concern for anyone within 300 meters (984 feet) in every direction around the entry of lava flow. The purpose of this rule is to ensure the safety of the public and vessels traveling in the navigable waters covered by the safety zone.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">V. Regulatory Analyses
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and Executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on a number of these statutes and Executive orders, and we discuss First Amendment rights of protestors.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">A. Regulatory Planning and Review
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Executive Orders 12866 (“Regulatory Planning and Review”) and 13563 (“Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review”) direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select those approaches that maximize net benefits. <ref href="/us/eo/13563">Executive Order 13563</ref> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref> (“Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs”), directs agencies to reduce regulation and control regulatory costs and provides that “for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process.”
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>, this rule has not been designated a “significant regulatory action. Accordingly, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has not reviewed it. As this rule is a non-significant regulatory action, it is exempt from the requirements of <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref>. See OMB's Memorandum titled “Interim Guidance Implementing Section 2 of the Executive Order of <date date="2017-01-30">January 30, 2017</date> titled `Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs' ” (February 2, 2017). A regulatory analysis follows.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This TFR extends, for an additional six months, the existing safety zone for the navigable waters surrounding the entry of lava from Kilauea volcano into the Pacific Ocean. The safety zone will remain to include waters within 300 meters (984 feet) of where lava enters the ocean. Entry of persons or vessels into the safety zone may only occur if granted permission by the COTP Honolulu, or his designated representative.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Lava has been entering the ocean at Kamokuna on Kilauea Volcano's south coast since July of 2016 and will continue to do so in the future. When lava enters the ocean, new hazards emerge: Plumes of corrosive seawater can irritate the skin, eyes, and lungs; explosions of debris and scalding water can injure passengers; sudden collapse of lava deltas can cause large waves potentially capsizing vessels. This TFR establishes a minimum safe operating distance in order to protect individuals and operators from the hazards of the Kilauea lava flow at sea.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This rule affects any vessel that would normally travel within 300 meters of points where lava reaches the ocean. Currently, four lava tour-boat operators have state licenses to operate from the Pohoiki Boat Ramp, the closest location to pick up passengers for tours of the Kilauea lava flow. The Coast Guard is also aware of one photographer who photographs the Kilauea lava flow. Since the implementation of the temporary safety zone, the COTP granted prior approval to these parties to enter the safety zone, so long as they comply with the conditions set by the COTP. These entities are required to notify the COTP by phone before each tour when entering the 300-meter safety zone.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">When the Coast Guard published the original TFR on <date date="2017-04-03">April 3, 2017</date>, owners and operators were required to prepare and submit a written request to the COTP to enter the safety zone. The TFR is a continuation of the requirements extending the safety zone for an additional six months, and therefore, we are presenting the costs associated with this TFR.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">First, the captain of a lava tour boat will initiate the request to enter the safety zone through an initial written request to the COTP. Based on waiver requests from the four state-licensed operations, the Coast Guard estimates it takes about 4-hours for an owner or operator to submit a written request to enter the safety zone. This includes the time it would take lava tour-boat owners or operators to respond to questions from the COTP concerning the waiver request. Lava tour-boat owners or operators are only required to make this written waiver request once for consideration by the COTP.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We obtained the mean hourly wage rate for a Captain of a lava tour boat from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Employment Statistics National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates for May 2016. Based on BLS's data, the mean hourly wage rate for Captains, Mates, and Pilots of Water Vessels with the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) occupational code of 53–5021 in the “Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation, Water” industry is $24.42. Because this is an unloaded hourly wage rate, we added a load factor of 1.52 derived from the BLS March 2017 “Employer Cost for Compensation” databases to obtain a loaded hourly wage rate of $37.12. We estimate the one-time initial cost for an owner or operator to prepare a written request and respond to comments from <?page num="45463"?>the Coast Guard to be about $148.47 ($37.12 per hour × 4 hours). We estimate the total cost of the temporary final rule to be about $593.88 ($148.47 × 4 lava tour-boat owners or operators).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Since all four tour operators and the photographer were each granted permission to enter the safety zone through an initial waiver request, the only potential cost to these tour operators is the cost of the initial request. Each owner or operator also will be required to notify the COTP before entering the safety zone. These entities shall notify the Coast Guard by phone; however, we do not estimate a cost for the call because the equipment already exists onboard the vessel and operators will make their calls in the normal course of a Captain's duty.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Federal Government also will incur costs of this temporary final rule. Government costs to implement the rule include the one-time cost of reviewing the waiver requests (we do not estimate a cost for the time to receive a call from an owner or operator to when entering a safety zone because the COTP conducts this review in the normal course of the COTP duties). To process the written request, we estimate one non-commissioned officer with a rank of E–7, and three officers with ranks of O–4, O–5, and O–6 will take about one hour each to review the written request. Based on the labor rates in table 1, we estimate the total cost to the Government of the temporary final rule to be about $378.00. Table 1 below summarizes these Government costs.<ref id="fnd4e4559" idref="fnd4e4565" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref>

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s601–612">5 U.S.C. 601–612</ref>, as amended, requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of regulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. Rules that are exempt from the Administrative Procedures Act include interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice; or when the agency for good cause finds that notice and comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. When an agency is not required to publish an NPRM for a rule, the RFA does not require an agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis. The Coast Guard was not required to publish an NPRM for this rule for the reasons stated in section II. “Background Information and Regulatory History” and therefore is not required to publish a regulatory flexibility analysis.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1–888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734–3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.

In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.

This rule involves a temporary safety zone lasting 6 months that will prohibit persons and vessels from entry into the 300 meters (984 feet) safety zone extending in all directions around the entry of lava flow into the Pacific Ocean. This safety zone is categorically excluded from further review under paragraph 34(g) of Figure 2–1 of the Commandant Instruction. A Record of Environmental Consideration supporting this determination is available in the docket where indicated under <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-2">ADDRESSES</inline>.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Is serving on active duty during a war or other military operation or national emergency;

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under the HEROES Act, the Secretary's authority to provide the waivers and modifications would have expired on <date date="2005-09-30">September 30, 2005</date>.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2007-12-26">December 26, 2007</date>, the Secretary published a document in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> (<ref href="/us/fr/72/72947">72 FR 72947</ref>) extending the waivers and modifications published on <date date="2003-12-12">December 12, 2003</date>, to <date date="2012-09-30">September 30, 2012</date>. In that document, the Secretary also indicated an intent to review the waivers and modifications published on <date date="2003-12-12">December 12, 2003</date>, in light of statutory and regulatory changes and to consider whether to change some or all of the published waivers and modifications.
</p>

Under that document, the updated waivers and modifications expire on <date date="2017-09-30">September 30, 2017</date>.








</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Secretary is updating the waivers and modifications to reflect statutory and regulatory changes that have occurred since the <date date="2012-09-27">September 27, 2012</date>, document was published. The waivers and modifications in this document will expire on <date date="2022-09-30">September 30, 2022</date>. With a few limited exceptions, the waivers and modifications in this document are the same waivers and modifications published in the <date date="2012-09-27">September 27, 2012</date>, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> document. However, <?page num="45466"?>the 2012 waivers and modifications have been updated in the following areas:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(1) The Secretary updated the need analysis modification to reflect the change in which tax year's information is collected on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and used to calculate the applicant's expected family contribution (EFC). Previously when completing a FAFSA, a student provided income information from the most recently completed tax year prior to the beginning of the financial aid application cycle (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> 2015 income information for the 2016–2017 FAFSA). Beginning with the 2017–2018 FAFSA, income information is collected from one tax year earlier—referred to as the “prior-prior year.” This change was made under the authority of section 480(a)(1)(B) of the HEA. This modification was also updated to make it consistent with the modification to professional judgment included in this document, which provides three options that a financial aid administrator (FAA) may use to make adjustments to the values of the items used to calculate the EFC to reflect a student's special circumstances.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(2) For the professional judgment modification, the Secretary clarified that in addition to using income information from the first or second calendar year of the award year, an institution may use another annual income that more accurately reflects the family's current financial circumstances.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(3) The Secretary updated the modifications related to verification of adjusted gross income (AGI) and U.S. income tax paid so that affected individuals under this category are no longer required to provide a signature on the statement certifying that he or she has not filed an income tax return or a request for a filing extension because he or she was called up for active duty or for qualifying National Guard duty during a war or other military operation or national emergency; or certifying the amount of AGI and U.S. income tax paid for the specified year.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(4) The Secretary extended the waiver assisting affected individuals with regard to the annual reevaluation requirements for FFEL and Direct Loan borrowers who are repaying loans under the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, and Direct Loan borrowers who are repaying loans under the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan to include borrowers who are repaying Direct Loans under the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) or Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) repayment plans.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(5) For the fourth category of affected individuals to which waivers and modifications apply, as described later in this document, the Secretary removed the reference to spouses of affected individuals who are serving on active duty or performing qualifying National Guard duty during a war or other military operation or national emergency, since the waivers under this category only pertain to the dependent student of such affected individuals.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(6) The Secretary updated the waiver related to verification signature requirements to waive the requirement for a parental signature on any verification documentation required for title IV eligibility for a dependent student because of the parent's status as an affected individual.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(7) The Secretary made a technical change to the waiver related to the section on required signatures on the FAFSA, the Student Aid Report (SAR), and the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR), replacing the reference to “ISIR” with “or submitting corrections electronically”. The Secretary also changed the reference to “responsible parent” to “relevant parent” to mean the parent whose information is reported on the FAFSA.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Secretary is issuing these waivers and modifications under the authority of the HEROES Act, <ref href="/us/usc/t20/s1098bb/a">20 U.S.C. 1098bb(a)</ref>. In accordance with the HEROES Act, the Secretary is providing the waivers and modifications of statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the student financial assistance programs under title IV of the HEA that the Secretary believes are appropriate to ensure that:

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 480 of the HEA provides that, in the calculation of an applicant's EFC, the term “total income,” which is used in the determination of “annual adjusted family income” and “available income,” is equal to the applicant's, the applicant's spouse's, or the applicant's parent's AGI plus untaxed income and benefits for the second preceding tax year minus excludable income. The HEROES Act allows an institution to substitute AGI plus untaxed income and benefits received in the first calendar year of the award year for which such determination is made for any affected individual, and for his or her spouse and dependents, if applicable, in order to reflect more accurately the financial condition of an affected individual and his or her family. The Secretary has determined that an institution has the option of using the applicant's original EFC (the EFC based on the income and tax information reported on the FAFSA), the EFC based on the data from the first calendar year of the award year, or the EFC based on another annual income that more accurately reflects the family's current financial circumstances.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 479A of the HEA specifically gives the FAA at an institution the authority to use professional judgment to make, on a case-by-case basis, adjustments to the cost of attendance or to the values of the items used in calculating the EFC to reflect a student's special circumstances. The Secretary is modifying this provision by removing the requirement that adjustments be made on a case-by-case basis for affected individuals. The use of professional judgment in Federal need analysis is discussed in the Federal Student Aid Handbook available at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">www.ifap.ed.gov.</inline>

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Secretary encourages FAAs to use professional judgment to reflect more accurately the financial need of affected individuals. To that end, the Secretary encourages institutions to determine an affected individual's need using one of the options listed below:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Using the AGI plus untaxed income and benefits received in the first calendar year of the award year;

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FAA must clearly document the reasons for any adjustment and the facts supporting the decision. In almost all cases, the FAA should have documentation from a third party with knowledge of the student's special circumstances. As usual, any professional judgment decisions made by an FAA that affect a student's eligibility for a subsidized student financial assistance program must be reported to the Central Processing System.

For a student who withdraws from an institution because of his or her status as an affected individual, the Secretary is waiving these statutory and regulatory requirements so that a student is not required to return or repay any overpayment of grant funds based on the Return of Title IV Funds provisions.
</p>

Therefore, an institution must not apply any title IV credit balance to the grant overpayment prior to: Using a credit balance to pay authorized charges; paying any amount of the title IV credit balance to the student or parent, in the case of a parent PLUS loan; or using the credit balance to reduce the student's title IV loan debt (with the student's authorization) as provided in Dear Colleague Letter GEN–04–03 (February 2004; revised November 2004).

Therefore, the Secretary is waiving the requirement that the student provide a written request for affected individuals who have difficulty providing a written request as a result of being an affected individual in this category.

To assist Federal Perkins Loan borrowers who are affected individuals in this category, the Secretary is waiving these statutory and regulatory requirements so that any forbearance based on a borrower's status as an affected individual in this category is excluded from the three-year cumulative limit.

The purpose of the three-month transition period is to assist borrowers so that they will not be required to reenter repayment immediately after they are no longer affected individuals in this category. In order to grant the borrower forbearance beyond the initial twelve- to fifteen-month period, supporting documentation from the borrower, a member of the borrower's family, or another reliable source is required.

To assist title IV borrowers who are affected individuals in this category, the Secretary is waiving the statutory and regulatory requirements that payments made to rehabilitate a loan must be consecutive or made over no more than ten consecutive months.

New Jersey's SIP revision addresses requirements of the Clean Air Act and the EPA's rules that require each state to submit periodic reports describing progress towards reasonable progress goals established for regional haze and a determination of the adequacy of the state's existing regional haze SIP. The EPA is approving New Jersey's determination that the State's regional haze SIP is adequate to meet these reasonable progress goals for the first implementation period which extends through 2018.

Thus, the Maryland SIP is not required to have this requirement for VOC in extreme nonattainment areas until such time as Maryland has an extreme ozone nonattainment area. Additionally, there are no anti-backsliding provisions found in <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s51.165/a/12">40 CFR 51.165(a)(12)</ref> in either COMAR 26.11.17 or the Maryland SIP because Maryland's major stationary source thresholds were established for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS nonattainment designations, which were and continue to be more stringent. Thus, antibacksliding requirements are not required. Maryland has not changed these major stationary source threshold provisions in COMAR 26.11.17.01(17), so they remain in Maryland's federally-approved SIP.<ref id="fnd4e6159" idref="fnd4e6168" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">10</ref> All of the sources located in the 2008 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas in Maryland are required to meet a major stationary source threshold of 25 tons or more per year of VOC or NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline>.

However, in the “Proposed Rules” section of today's <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>, EPA is publishing a separate document that will serve as the proposal to approve the SIP revision if adverse comments are filed.

If EPA receives adverse comment, EPA will publish a timely withdrawal in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> informing the public that the rule will not take effect. EPA will address all public comments in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action.

Infrastructure SIPs address the applicable requirements of Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110, which requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of each new or revised NAAQS promulgated by the EPA. These SIPs are commonly referred to as “infrastructure” SIPs. The infrastructure requirements are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">EPA is not taking action on section 110(a)(2)(I). Section 110(a)(2)(I) requires that in the case of a plan or plan revision for areas designated as nonattainment areas, states must meet applicable requirements of part D of the CAA, relating to SIP requirements for designated nonattainment areas. EPA does not expect infrastructure SIP submissions to address element (I). The specific SIP submissions for designated nonattainment areas, as required under CAA title I, part D, are subject to different submission schedules than those for section 110 infrastructure elements. EPA will take action on part D attainment plan SIP submissions through a separate rulemaking governed by the requirements for nonattainment areas, as described in part D.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We are publishing this direct final rule without a prior proposed rule because we view this as a noncontroversial action and anticipate no adverse comment. However, in the “Proposed Rules” section of this issue of the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>, we are publishing a separate document that will serve as the proposed rule to approve the SIP revision if adverse comments are received on this direct final rule. We will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting must do so at this time. For further information about commenting on this rule, see the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-2">ADDRESSES</inline> section of this document. If EPA receives adverse comment, we will publish a timely withdrawal in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> informing the public that this direct final rule will not take effect. We will address all public comments in any subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing withdrawal of the federal implementation plan (FIP) provisions that require affected electricity generating units (EGUs) in Texas to participate in Phase 2 of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) trading programs for annual emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline>) and nitrogen oxides (NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline>). Withdrawal of the FIP requirements is intended to address a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) remanding the CSAPR Phase 2 SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> budget for Texas to the EPA for reconsideration. With this action, the EPA is also determining that, following withdrawal of the FIP requirements, sources in Texas do not contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other state with regard to the 1997 national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for fine particulate matter (PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline>). Accordingly, we are also determining that the EPA has no obligation to issue new FIP requirements for Texas sources to address transported PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> pollution under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) with regard to that NAAQS. Finally, the EPA is also affirming the continued validity of the Agency's 2012 determination that participation in CSAPR meets the Regional Haze Rule's criteria for an alternative to the application of source-specific best available retrofit technology (BART). The EPA has determined that changes to CSAPR's geographic scope resulting from the actions EPA has taken or expects to take in response to the D.C. Circuit's remand do not affect the continued validity of participation in CSAPR as a BART alternative, because the changes in geographic scope would not have adversely affected the results of the air quality modeling analysis upon which the EPA based the 2012 determination.

While Administrative Procedure Act (APA) section 553(d)<ref id="fnd4e6984" idref="fnd4e6993" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">9</ref> generally provides that rules may not take effect earlier than 30 days after they are published in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register,</inline> CAA section 307(d)(1) clarifies that “[t]he provisions of [APA] section 553 . . . shall not, except as expressly provided in this section, apply to actions to which this subsection applies.” Thus, APA section 553(d) does not apply to this rule. Nevertheless, in making this rule effective immediately upon publication, the EPA has considered the purposes underlying APA section 553(d). The primary purpose of the prescribed 30-day waiting period is to give affected parties a reasonable time to adjust their behavior and prepare before a final rule takes effect. This rule does not impose any new regulatory requirements and therefore does not necessitate time for affected sources to adjust their behavior or otherwise prepare for implementation. Further, APA section 553(d) expressly allows an effective date less than 30 days after publication for a rule that “grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction.” This rule relieves Texas EGUs of certain FIP requirements that would otherwise apply. Consequently, making this rule effective immediately upon publication is consistent with the purposes of APA section 553(d).

Circuit's remand. As discussed in section IV, the sensitivity analysis indicates clearly that the demonstration remains valid despite these changes in CSAPR's geographic scope, supporting the continued validity of EPA's 2012 conclusion that CSAPR participation meets the Regional Haze Rule's criteria for a BART alternative.<ref id="fnd4e7271" idref="fnd4e7277" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">22</ref> Consequently, in this action the EPA is affirming the current Regional Haze Rule provision at <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s51.308/e/4">40 CFR 51.308(e)(4)</ref> authorizing the use of CSAPR participation as a BART alternative for BART-eligible EGUs for a given pollutant in states whose EGUs continue to participate in a CSAPR trading program for that pollutant.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">While not discussed in the court's decision, the projections of 2014 air quality for a PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> receptor in Madison County, Illinois (the only PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> receptor with projected air quality problems to which Texas was linked) in the final CSAPR record are analogous to the 2014 air quality projections for the ozone receptors described above, in that the air quality problems at the Madison County receptor were projected to be resolved in 2014 before any emission reductions from CSAPR. In light of the court's holding as to the legal import of the 2014 base case air quality projections for the ozone receptors described above, the EPA considered the legal import of the analogous 2014 base case air quality projections for the Madison County PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> receptor with respect to Texas' PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline>-related obligations under CSAPR. There are three relevant record data elements. First, the record indicates that the only PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> receptor to which Texas is linked for purposes of determining possible obligations under the good neighbor provision is the receptor in Madison County, Illinois.<ref id="fnd4e7522" idref="fnd4e7567" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">29</ref> Second, the projected maximum design value <ref id="fnd4e7526" idref="fnd4e7575" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">30</ref> for annual PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> at the Madison County receptor is 15.02 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m<sup style="-uslm-sgm:SU">3</sup>) in the 2014 base case.<ref id="fnd4e7536" idref="fnd4e7583" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">31</ref> Finally, the value that the EPA used to determine whether a particular PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> receptor should be identified as having air quality problems that may trigger transport obligations with regard to the 1997 annual PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> NAAQS is 15.05 µg/m<sup style="-uslm-sgm:SU">3</sup>, which is higher than the Madison County maximum design value in the 2014 base case.<ref id="fnd4e7550" idref="fnd4e7594" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">32</ref> Thus, the reevaluation of the final CSAPR record in light of the D.C. Circuit's holding indicates that the record does not support a finding of a transport obligation for Texas under CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) with regard to this NAAQS as of the beginning of Phase 2 of the CSAPR trading programs for SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> and annual NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline>, and the Agency accordingly finds that the state's obligation is resolved without a need for further emission reductions, including the emission reductions from CSAPR. The finding that Texas's transport obligation with regard to this NAAQS is resolved as of the start of Phase 2 of the CSAPR trading programs without the need for any emission reductions from CSAPR removes the EPA's authority to issue new FIP requirements for purposes of responding to the court's remand of the state's CSAPR Phase 2 SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> budget. The finding likewise eliminates any obligation of the EPA to issue new FIP requirements addressing a remaining transport obligation of the state with regard to this NAAQS following withdrawal of the existing CSAPR FIP requirements, because the state has no such remaining transport obligation following the withdrawal.

If the projected maximum design value was above the triggering threshold but the projected average design value was not, the receptor was considered a maintenance receptor. Thus, if the projected maximum design value was not above the triggering threshold, the receptor was not considered either a nonattainment receptor or a maintenance receptor. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> 76 FR at 48233.</p>

The analysis for the 2006 24-hour PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> NAAQS is essentially identical to the analysis described above with regard to the 1997 annual PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> NAAQS.

Underlying the commenters' arguments is an apparent belief that a revised, higher CSAPR budget, whether issued through a FIP or approved through a SIP, would automatically enable Texas to rely on CSAPR participation as an alternative to source-specific SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> BART requirements for the State's EGUs under <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s51.308/e/4">40 CFR 51.308(e)(4)</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The EPA disagrees with these comments. As an initial matter, the D.C. Circuit in fact did not direct the Agency to develop replacement budgets for the Texas SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> budget or any of the other remanded CSAPR Phase 2 budgets. Rather, the court found that certain budgets were invalid and remanded to the EPA to “reconsider” them,<ref id="fnd4e7758" idref="fnd4e7781" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">38</ref> a general instruction that encompasses a range of possible Agency actions upon reconsideration. The commenters cite no statement from the court's opinion that requires the establishment of replacement budgets, but assert that such a requirement must be inferred from the court's other statements or determinations. For example, the commenters suggest that because the court remanded the budgets without vacatur instead of vacating the budgets outright, the court must have intended for the Agency to replace rather than simply withdraw the budgets. However, the court actually provided a different rationale for remanding without vacatur, including the statement that “some good neighbor obligations <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">may</inline> be appropriate for <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">some</inline> of the relevant states.” <ref id="fnd4e7768" idref="fnd4e7789" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">39</ref> The reference to “some” of the states indicates that the court considered it likely that replacement budgets would not be established in <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">every</inline> instance, and the use of the word “may” indicates that the court considered it possible that replacement budgets would not be established in <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">any</inline> instance. Thus, contrary to the commenters' claims, the court's opinion clearly affords the Agency the discretion to determine the appropriate response to the remand and does not prevent the Agency from determining upon reconsideration that the program is no longer needed for a particular state with respect to a particular pollutant and consequently not establishing a replacement budget.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The commenters make several additional arguments in support of their contention that the FIP withdrawal is not responsive to the D.C. Circuit's instructions. One commenter asserts that because the court stated that the Agency could consider new information in responding to the remand, the court must have intended for the Agency's response to involve the establishment of replacement budgets. This claim is a <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">non sequitur</inline>—the court's acknowledgement that additional information may be considered says nothing about what the Agency may or must conclude from consideration of that information. The same commenter also asserts that the Agency may not rely on lack of FIP authority as the basis for not establishing a revised budget because lack of FIP authority was not the basis cited by the court for remanding the budget. This claim is also a <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">non sequitur</inline>—the Agency lacks authority to issue a revised budget and therefore may not do so, regardless of what additional defects the court may have cited in ordering the remand.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The other commenter asserts that the FIP withdrawal would disrupt allowance markets, contrary to the concern expressed by the D.C. Circuit that outright vacatur, rather than remand without vacatur, could have that impact. While the EPA agrees with the concern expressed by the court and the commenter regarding the potentially disruptive effects of outright vacatur on <?page num="45487"?>allowance markets, the Agency does not agree that the court's concern regarding unintended consequences of a judicial vacatur provides a basis for not taking final action at this time to withdraw the Texas FIP requirements, for two reasons. First, the EPA believes that the court did not intend for its expression of concern to constrain the Agency's range of possible responses to the remand. As discussed above, it is clear from the opinion that the court anticipated the possibility that upon reconsideration the EPA would determine that some, or even all, of the remanded budgets should be withdrawn and not replaced. Second, in this instance, emissions data reported by the EGUs covered by the CSAPR trading programs for SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> and annual NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline> demonstrate that withdrawal of the FIP provisions requiring Texas EGUs to participate in these programs will not cause allowance market disruption for the programs' remaining participants. Under both programs, the totals of the emissions reported by participating EGUs for both 2015 and 2016 in states other than Texas were less than the sums of the Phase 2 emissions budgets for these other states.<ref id="fnd4e7818" idref="fnd4e7829" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">40</ref> Likewise, under both programs the totals of the emissions reported by Texas EGUs for both 2015 and 2016 were less than the Texas Phase 2 budgets.<ref id="fnd4e7822" idref="fnd4e7843" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">41</ref> The elimination from the programs of Texas EGUs and the allowances allocated to Texas EGUs is therefore not expected to cause either shortages of allowances available for purchase by EGUs in the other states or the loss of an important market for sale of surplus allowances by EGUs in the other states. In these circumstances, the EPA anticipates that the FIP withdrawal will have little impact on the allowance market in either trading program.

That rule allows a state to rely on its EGUs' participation in a CSAPR SIP trading program only if the EPA approves the SIP as “meeting the requirements of” the CSAPR regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s52.38">40 CFR 52.38</ref> and 52.39.<ref id="fnd4e7896" idref="fnd4e7934" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">45</ref> As relevant here, the CSAPR regulations at § 52.39 expressly preclude a state's SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> emissions budget from exceeding the SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> emissions budget established under the CSAPR FIP trading program that the CSAPR SIP trading program would replace.<ref id="fnd4e7906" idref="fnd4e7939" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">46</ref> Thus, even if the D.C.

As explained in the proposal, in thirteen instances, the state will retain eligibility to rely on the CSAPR-better-than-BART rule for the pollutant in question through either the EPA's establishment of a new CSAPR budget to address a more stringent NAAQS (eight seasonal NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline> budgets), the state's sources' continued participation in a different CSAPR trading program for the same pollutant (two seasonal NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline> budgets), or the state's voluntary adoption in a SIP revision of a CSAPR state budget as stringent as the remanded CSAPR FIP budget (three SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> budgets).<ref id="fnd4e7976" idref="fnd4e7999" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">48</ref> In the remaining two instances where a remanded budget is being withdrawn and none of the three options for preserving eligibility to rely on CSAPR-better-than-BART applies—Texas' SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> budget and Florida's seasonal NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline> budget—the state is losing the <?page num="45488"?>opportunity to rely on CSAPR participation as a BART alternative for that pollutant.<ref id="fnd4e7989" idref="fnd4e8004" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">49</ref> Thus, Texas is being treated the same as every other state with respect to use of the CSAPR-better-than-BART rule.<ref id="fnd4e7993" idref="fnd4e8012" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">50</ref>

The CSAPR-better-than-BART rule rests on an analytic demonstration that implementation of CSAPR as expected to take effect at that time would achieve greater reasonable progress than BART toward the national goal of natural visibility conditions in Class I areas. As part of the proposal for this action, the EPA included a sensitivity analysis to the 2012 analytic demonstration showing that the 2012 analysis would have supported the same conclusion if the actions being taken in response to the D.C. Circuit's remand of various CSAPR Phase 2 budgets <ref id="fnd4e8437" idref="fnd4e8446" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">67</ref> had been reflected in the 2012 analysis. In this action, upon consideration of comments received, the EPA is affirming the sensitivity analysis from the proposal that concluded that the 2012 analytic demonstration is still valid and is consequently affirming that there is no need for revision of the CSAPR-better-than-BART rule as a result of the changes in CSAPR's geographic scope resulting from the Agency's set of responses to the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">EME Homer City II</inline> decision.

The EPA used the results of the three scenarios to compare the projected visibility impacts of CSAPR and BART under a two-pronged “better-than-BART” test.<ref id="fnd4e8484" idref="fnd4e8498" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">69</ref> The first prong—a requirement that visibility must not decline in any Class I area under the proposed BART alternative—was evaluated by comparing the projected visibility conditions under the original CSAPR scenario and the base case scenario. The second prong—a requirement that there must be an overall visibility improvement on average across all affected Class I areas under the proposed BART alternative relative to source-specific BART—was evaluated by comparing the projected visibility conditions under the original CSAPR scenario and the BART scenario. Based on these comparisons, and also taking account of revisions made to CSAPR after the 2011 modeling but before or contemporaneous with the 2012 CSAPR-better-than-BART rule, the EPA concluded that the original CSAPR scenario satisfied both prongs of the test.

The CSAPR regulations expressly provide for approval of CSAPR SIPs that meet certain conditions as replacements for CSAPR FIPs, and Georgia and South Carolina (as well as Alabama) have elected to submit such SIPs. The comparison that the commenter draws to the EPA's previous findings that states may no longer rely on participation in CAIR as a BART alternative is inapt, because the basis for such previous findings was that CAIR itself (including its trading programs) would not exist, not that particular CAIR budgets were invalid. Here, the CSAPR trading program will still exist, making it possible for the states to continue to participate in CSAPR through voluntary SIPs notwithstanding the invalidation of the EPA's authority to require compliance with the remanded budgets through FIPs addressing the states' transport obligations.

To the extent the commenter believes that for purposes of a sensitivity analysis the Agency may rely only on a SIP that has been approved and not on a SIP or proposed state rule that has been submitted for EPA approval but not yet approved, the Agency disagrees. Both states' rules take the approach of incorporating by reference the federal CSAPR trading program rules, including the relevant budget amounts, so there are no substantive differences between the state trading program rules being adopted by the states for inclusion in their SIPs and the federal trading program rules that are being replaced.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The commenter states that the sensitivity analysis is arbitrary because it is based on outdated material, and that instead of evaluating whether the 2012 analytic demonstration remains valid, the EPA must perform an entirely new analytic demonstration based on a new air quality modeling analysis using more current data.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The EPA disagrees with this comment. While criticizing aspects of the Agency's analytic methodology, the commenter does not dispute that the sensitivity analysis as conducted by the EPA using that methodology shows that the 2012 analytic demonstration would have been strengthened rather than weakened by the changes in CSAPR's geographic scope that are occurring as a result of the D.C. Circuit's remand. (The methodological criticisms are addressed as the next comment below.) Further, the commenter offers no compelling support for the suggestion that, in the absence of any reason to doubt the conclusion from the 2012 analytic demonstration, the EPA must nevertheless conduct an entirely new demonstration. As an asserted legal rationale for the need for a new analysis, the commenter cites the Regional Haze Rule provisions for approval of BART alternatives, noting that the provision that the EPA followed in approving the CSAPR-better-than-BART rule requires a demonstration based on an air quality modeling analysis.<ref id="fnd4e8742" idref="fnd4e8748" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">79</ref> The EPA has performed one such air quality modeling analysis and in this action has shown that the analysis already performed would continue to support a conclusion that CSAPR meets the criteria for a BART alternative notwithstanding changes in CSAPR's geographic scope. Contrary to the commenter's suggestion, the regulations do not say that the EPA must perform an entirely new analysis. Similarly, the commenter's assertion that changes in industry data since 2011 necessitate a new analytic demonstration amounts to a call for recurring demonstrations that a BART alternative results in greater reasonable progress than BART as the industry evolves, rather than a one-time demonstration when the alternative is approved. The regulations include no such requirement for recurring demonstrations.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The commenter states that the EPA's methodology for conducting the sensitivity analysis as set forth in the proposal failed to adequately consider whether changes in a revised CSAPR scenario regarding the geographic distribution of emissions across states or <?page num="45492"?>within individual states might lead to violations of the analytic criteria that the EPA relied on to find that CSAPR qualifies as a BART alternative. In particular, the commenter raises the theoretical possibility that, in a revised CSAPR scenario where Texas EGUs no longer participate in CSAPR for SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline>, some individual sources in other CSAPR states could buy additional allowances and increase their emissions, and that such increases in emissions in turn could cause adverse visibility impacts in some individual Class I areas (thereby violating the first prong of the two-pronged test described above). More generally, the commenter asserts that without new modeling the EPA “has no data” and has “simply assume[d]” that the two prongs of the test would be satisfied under such a revised scenario.

To the contrary, the Agency's proposed conclusions explicitly rely on data drawn from the modeling results in the record for the CSAPR-better-than-BART rule. The EPA explained in the proposal, first, how the data from the earlier rulemaking record showed that a revised CSAPR scenario would reflect a projected reduction in Texas SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> emissions of 127,300 tons (or more) <ref id="fnd4e8772" idref="fnd4e8785" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">80</ref> along with projected increases in Florida and Texas NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline> emissions of at most a few thousand tons and, second, why it was logical to conclude from these projected emissions changes that, relative to the modeled BART and base case scenarios, the revised CSAPR scenario would have shown even larger visibility improvements than the original CSAPR scenario.<ref id="fnd4e8779" idref="fnd4e8809" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">81</ref> The commenter provides no data of any kind, let alone data that might challenge the data presented in the proposal.

The reason for this adjustment is that in the original CSAPR scenario, Texas EGUs were projected to emit 22,300 tons of SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> in excess of the state's SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> budget.<ref id="fnd4e8879" idref="fnd4e8920" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">85</ref> This would have been possible through the use of allowances purchased from EGUs in other SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> Group 2 states.

Much or all of the total potential increase in emissions in the other states would be projected to occur in Alabama and Georgia, because in the original CSAPR scenario the collective emissions from Kansas EGUs were projected to already be at the state's “assurance level”—the emissions level above which EGUs trigger a CSAPR provision requiring the surrender of three allowances instead of one allowance per ton of emissions—and the collective emissions from Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Carolina EGUs were projected to already be close to their states' respective assurance levels.<ref id="fnd4e8890" idref="fnd4e8932" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">86</ref> After accounting for the potential 22,300-ton offsetting adjustment, the net regional SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> reduction under the revised CSAPR scenario relative to the original CSAPR scenario would be projected to be approximately 105,000 tons (or more) instead of 127,300 tons (or more) as described in the proposed sensitivity analysis.<ref id="fnd4e8897" idref="fnd4e8939" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">87</ref> For the reasons below, the EPA has considered both the projected decrease in Texas SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> emissions and the projected aggregated increase in SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline>

Regardless of the amount or direction of any modeled change in Texas EGUs' CSAPR allowance purchases, that change would generally have been matched by an equal and opposite change in Texas EGUs' projected emissions under CSAPR, with the result that the overall net projected reduction in emissions caused by removing Texas from CSAPR for SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> would continue to be at least 105,000 tons. The maximum amount of CSAPR SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> allowances that Texas could purchase from other states and use in a given year without incurring 3-for-1 allowance surrender requirements is approximately 53,000 tons, which is the amount of Texas' SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> variability limit—the difference between the state's budget and its assurance level—under the CSAPR regulations. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s97.710/b/7">40 CFR 97.710(b)(7)</ref>.</p>

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As summarized above, the first prong of the two-pronged test requires that visibility conditions must not decline in any Class I area. In the 2012 analytic demonstration, the EPA evaluated this prong by comparing visibility impacts at each affected Class I area under the original CSAPR scenario and the base case scenario. The situation identified by the commenter in which emissions under a revised CSAPR scenario might rise at some individual EGUs sufficiently to cause a decline in visibility at some individual Class I area relative to visibility conditions in the base case scenario—that is, without either CSAPR or BART—would be a very unusual event and likely can be ruled out as impossible, or nearly so, in a scenario such as the revised CSAPR scenario being considered. Under the base case scenario, EGUs incur no cost at all under CSAPR for emitting a ton of SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline>. In contrast, under either the original CSAPR scenario or a revised CSAPR scenario, EGUs would incur some cost per ton of SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> emissions under CSAPR, and where that new cost is the principal change from the base case scenario, EGUs that emit SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> would generally be projected to either decrease or maintain their emissions relative to the base case scenario where that cost was not present. If in a revised CSAPR scenario, allowances are more plentiful and the cost incurred per ton of SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> emissions therefore is less than the cost per ton under the original CSAPR scenario, some EGUs that emit SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> would be projected to reduce their SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> emissions by a smaller amount than in the original CSAPR scenario, but they generally would not be projected to significantly <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">increase</inline> their emissions relative to the base case scenario. An exception to this general principle could occur if some other factor influencing EGUs' operating decisions, such as electricity demand or relative fuel prices, also changed. The EPA therefore considered whether the removal of Texas from CSAPR could have been projected to result in any material change in demand for generation from other states or relative fuel prices in other states in a revised CSAPR scenario compared to the original CSAPR scenario.<ref id="fnd4e8997" idref="fnd4e9003" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">88</ref>

Unlike subbituminous coal and natural gas, lignite is an inherently local fuel that is consumed near the point of extraction because the fuel's low energy content per unit of weight makes shipment over long distances uneconomic. Thus, although the increase in Texas EGUs' projected usage of lignite is fairly large (8.2% of projected national usage of lignite under the original CSAPR scenario), any resulting increase in the local prices of lignite would not be expected to affect the mix of fuels used in other states.

The results of the comparison clearly indicate that the general principle applies in this instance: 77 Units were projected to reduce their SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> emissions by 1,000 tons or more (in amounts up to 57,000 tons), 106 units were projected to essentially maintain their SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> emissions (increasing or decreasing by between 0 and 1,000 tons), and 2 units were projected to increase their SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> emissions by approximately 1,100 tons each.<ref id="fnd4e9073" idref="fnd4e9110" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">91</ref> A similar comparison at the state level shows that collective SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> emissions from the sets of EGUs in each of the seven states were also projected to decrease from the base case scenario to the original CSAPR scenario (in amounts ranging from 1,900 tons for Nebraska to 248,800 tons for Alabama).<ref id="fnd4e9080" idref="fnd4e9118" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">92</ref> In combination with the data above showing that removal of Texas from CSAPR for SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> would not be expected to cause changes in demand for generation or relative fuel prices in other states, the EPA believes that these data on how EGUs were projected to comply with CSAPR in the original CSAPR scenario indicate that in a revised CSAPR scenario where Texas is removed from CSAPR for SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> and 22,300 additional allowances (or up to 53,000 allowances, as noted earlier <ref id="fnd4e9091" idref="fnd4e9125" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">93</ref>) therefore become available to the EGUs in the other SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> Group 2 states, few if any EGUs would respond to the availability of the additional allowances by increasing their emissions materially above their emissions in the base case scenario. Further, even if some EGUs did increase their emissions above their emissions in the base case scenario, because of the regional nature of sulfate formation from SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> emissions and the very large decreases in SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> emissions across the broader region, the EPA believes that any such local increase would be unlikely to cause localized visibility degradation in any Class I area near a CSAPR state affected by the removal of Texas from CSAPR for SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline>. In consequence, the Agency finds it reasonable to conclude that in such a revised CSAPR scenario, no such Class I areas would experience declines in visibility conditions relative to the base case scenario.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In order to implement the withdrawal of the FIP provisions requiring Texas EGUs to participate in the CSAPR NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline> Annual Trading Program and the CSAPR SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> Group 2 Trading Program with regard to emissions occurring in Phase 2 of those programs, the EPA is amending the regulatory text at <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s52.38/a/2">40 CFR 52.38(a)(2)</ref>, 52.39(c), 52.2283(c), and 52.2284(c) to provide that Texas EGUs are subject to requirements under these two programs with regard to emissions occurring in 2015 and 2016 only. Conforming amendments to cross-references are being made at § 52.38(a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(8)(iii) and § 52.39(g), (h), (i), (j), and (m)(3).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The EPA is also clarifying the CSAPR regulations by adding the introductory headings “Annual emissions” and “Ozone season emissions” to § 52.38(a) and (b), respectively, and by amending the wording of the regulatory text at §§ 52.38(b)(2)(i) and 52.39(b) to parallel the wording of the newly amended regulatory text at §§ 52.38(a)(2)(i) and 52.39(c)(1). These editorial clarifications do not alter any existing regulatory requirements.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Finally, the EPA is correcting the CSAPR regulations applicable to South Carolina EGUs by amending the regulatory text at § 52.2141(b) to reference CSAPR SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> Group 2 allowances and <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/p97">40 CFR part 97</ref>, subpart DDDDD instead of CSAPR SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> Group 1 allowances and <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/p97">40 CFR part 97</ref>, subpart CCCCC. The corrections make the text at § 52.2141(b) consistent with the existing text at § 52.2141(a), and the two paragraphs together now correctly reflect the existing regulatory requirements applicable to South Carolina EGUs as already set forth at § 52.39(c) and (k).

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">I certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In making this determination, the impact of concern is any significant adverse economic impact on small entities. An agency may certify that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities if the rule relieves regulatory burden, has no net burden, or otherwise has a positive economic effect on the small entities subject to the rule. This action withdraws existing regulatory requirements for some entities and does not impose new requirements on any entity. We have therefore concluded that this action will either relieve or have no net regulatory burden for all directly regulated small entities.

It will not have substantial direct effects on tribal governments, on the relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the federal government and Indian tribes. This action simply eliminates certain federal regulatory requirements that the D.C. Circuit has held invalid. Thus, <ref href="/us/eo/13175">Executive Order 13175</ref> does not apply to this action. Consistent with the EPA Policy on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribes, the EPA consulted with tribal officials while developing CSAPR. A summary of that consultation is provided in the preamble for CSAPR, <ref href="/us/fr/76/48208">76 FR 48208</ref>, 48346 (August 8, 2011).

This action simply eliminates certain federal regulatory requirements that the D.C. Circuit has held invalid. Consistent with <ref href="/us/eo/12898">Executive Order 12898</ref> and the EPA's environmental justice policies, the EPA considered effects on low-income populations, minority populations, and indigenous peoples while developing CSAPR.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">CAA section 307(b)(1) indicates which federal appellate courts have venue for petitions of review of final actions by the EPA. This section provides, in part, that petitions for review must be filed in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals if (i) the agency action consists of “nationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final action taken, by the Administrator,” or (ii) such action is locally or regionally applicable, if “such action is based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action the Administrator finds and publishes that such action is based on such a determination.” This final action is “nationally applicable.” In addition, the EPA finds that all aspects of this action are based on a determination of “nationwide scope and effect” within the meaning of section 307(b)(1).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">First, the EPA's withdrawal of FIP requirements under the CSAPR program for Texas is being undertaken in response to a remand by the D.C. Circuit in litigation that challenged numerous aspects of CSAPR with implications for multiple states and resulted in the remand of fifteen budgets for thirteen states. Retaining review in the D.C. Circuit is appropriate and avoids the potential that another court is forced to interpret the remand order of a sister circuit. Also, the finding that, after the FIP withdrawal, Texas has no remaining obligation to address interstate transport with respect to the 1997 annual PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> NAAQS is based on a common core of factual findings and analyses concerning the transport of pollutants between the different states subject to CSAPR, which is a nationally applicable program. Further, this action is based on a determination that modifies the scope and effect of CSAPR; thus, any judicial review of this action will necessarily implicate the national-level policies, technical analyses, or interpretations that undergird this nationwide program.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Second, in express consideration of the effect of the withdrawal of Texas FIP requirements accomplished through this final action, the EPA is affirming the continued validity of <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s51.308/e/4">40 CFR 51.308(e)(4)</ref>, a regulatory provision available to each of the 27 States whose sources currently participate in one or more CSAPR trading programs. This determination affects the rights and interests of regulated parties and other stakeholders throughout the eastern United States relying on or otherwise affected by that regulatory provision.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For these reasons, this final action is nationally applicable and, in addition, <?page num="45496"?>the Administrator finds that this final action is based on a determination of nationwide scope and effect for purposes of section 307(b)(1). Thus, pursuant to section 307(b) any petitions for review of this action must be filed in the D.C. Circuit within 60 days from the date of publication of this action in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, pursuant to CAA sections 307(d)(1)(B), 307(d)(1)(J), and 307(d)(1)(V), the Administrator determines that this action is subject to the provisions of section 307(d). CAA section 307(d)(1)(B) provides that section 307(d) applies to, among other things, “the promulgation or revision of an implementation plan by the Administrator under [CAA section 110(c)].” <ref href="/us/usc/t42/s7607/d/1/B">42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(1)(B)</ref>. Under section 307(d)(1)(J), the provisions of section 307(d) apply to the “promulgation or revision of regulations . . . relating to . . . protection of visibility.” <ref href="/us/usc/t42/s7607/d/1/J">42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(1)(J)</ref>. Under section 307(d)(1)(V), the provisions of section 307(d) also apply to “such other actions as the Administrator may determine.” <ref href="/us/usc/t42/s7607/d/1/V">42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(1)(V)</ref>. The agency has complied with the procedural requirements of CAA section 307(d) during the course of this rulemaking.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">CAA section 307(b)(1) also provides that filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this rule does not affect the finality of the rule for the purposes of judicial review, does not extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and does not postpone the effectiveness of the rule. Under CAA section 307(b)(2), the requirements established by this rule may not be challenged separately in any civil or criminal proceedings brought by the EPA to enforce these requirements.

Infrastructure SIPs address the applicable requirements of Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110, which requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of each new or revised NAAQS promulgated by the EPA. These SIPs are commonly referred to as “infrastructure” SIPs. The infrastructure requirements are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA.

New York's SIP revision addresses requirements of the Clean Air Act and the EPA's rules that require each state to submit periodic reports describing progress towards reasonable progress goals established for regional haze and a determination of the adequacy of the state's existing regional haze SIP. The EPA is approving New York's determination that the State's regional haze SIP is adequate to meet these reasonable progress goals for the first implementation period which extends through 2018.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FOIA, <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s552">5 U.S.C. 552</ref>, establishes basic procedures for public access to agency records. The FOIA requires federal agencies to issue regulations to establish procedures to implement the FOIA. The CSB's current FOIA rule is codified at <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/p1601">40 CFR part 1601</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This interim rule revises <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/p1601">40 CFR part 1601</ref> to implement provisions of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 and to make additional legal updates. Specifically, this interim rule implements changes to conform to the requirements of the following amendments to the FOIA since the adoption of the CSB's current FOIA rule: The OPEN Government Act of 2007, <ref href="/us/pl/110/175">Public Law 110–175</ref>, the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, <ref href="/us/pl/111/83">Public Law 111–83</ref>, and the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, <ref href="/us/pl/114/185">Public Law 114–185</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For example, the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 introduced several changes to current law, including, but not <?page num="45501"?>limited to the following: An increase in the minimum time for an administrative appeal to ninety (90) day; increased opportunities for dispute resolution services at various times throughout the FOIA process; waiver of fees if agencies do not meet mandated time limits; proactive disclosure of records of general interest to the public that are appropriate for such disclosure; and application of the Department of Justice's “foreseeable harm” standard as the basis for withholding information pursuant to a FOIA exemption, <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s552/a/8/A/i/I">5 U.S.C. 552(a)(8)(A)(i)(I)</ref>.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The CSB is issuing an interim final rule to revise its current FOIA regulation because these changes are required by statutory amendments to FOIA since the adoption of the CSB's original FOIA rule in 2000. By issuing an interim final rule, these regulatory changes will take effect sooner than would be possible with the publication of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Even though the CSB has issued an interim final rule, the CSB welcomes public comments from interested persons regarding any aspect of the changes made by this interim final rule. Please refer to the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-2">ADDRESSES</inline> section above for guidance on submitting comments.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The CSB's implementation of this rule as an interim final rule, with provision for post-promulgation public comment, is based on section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act. <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b">5 U.S.C. 553(b)</ref>. Under section 553(b), an agency may issue a rule without notice of proposed rulemaking and the pre-promulgation opportunity for public comment, with regard to “interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.” The CSB has determined that many of the revisions are to interpretive rules issued by the CSB, as they merely advise the public of the CSB's implementation of recent amendments to the FOIA. Moreover, the CSB has determined that the remaining revisions are rules of agency procedure or practice, as they do not change the substantive standards the agency applies in implementing the FOIA. The CSB has also concluded that there is good cause to find that a pre-publication public comment period is unnecessary. These revisions to the existing regulations in <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/p1601">40 CFR part 1601</ref> merely implement statutory changes, align the CSB's regulations with controlling judicial decisions, and clarify agency procedures.

The CSB has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule implements the procedures for processing FOIA requests within the CSB. Under the FOIA, agencies may recover only the direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating the records processed for the requesters. Thus, fees accessed by CSB will be nominal. Further, the “small entities” that make FOIA requests, as compared with individual and other requesters, are relatively few in number.

However, if another law sets specific procedures for disclosure that supersede the FOIA, then CSB must process a request in accordance with the procedures that apply to those specific documents. If a request is received for disclosure of a document to the public that is not required to be released under the provisions of law other than the FOIA, then the CSB must consider the request under the FOIA and the regulations in this part. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s552a">5 U.S.C. 552a</ref>, are processed in accordance with CSB's Privacy Act regulations (part 1602 of this chapter), as well as under this subpart.

See § 1601.40 [discussing fees in more detail]. If the fee will be greater than $25.00, then the CSB must contact the requester to discuss how the requester wants to proceed.

In determining which records are responsive to a request, the CSB ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search.

A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s552/c">5 U.S.C. 552(c)</ref>, is not considered responsive to a request.

However, if the CSB and the originating agency jointly agree that the CSB is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.

                                                   <content> The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement agency responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if an agency locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the CSB must coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on whether the record can be disclosed. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination will then be conveyed to the requester by the CSB.

                                                <content> The CSB has a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. In addition, the CSB uses two standard processing tracks- one for simple requests and a separate track for complex requests. The CSB will assign requests to the simple or complex track based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors the CSB may consider are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. The CSB must advise each requester of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, will offer a requester an opportunity to narrow or modify their request so that it can be placed in the simple processing track.

                                                <content> Whenever the CSB cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the CSB extends the time limit on that basis, the CSB must, before expiration of the twenty (20) day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which the CSB estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds ten (10) working days, the CSB must, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The CSB must make available its designated FOIA Contact or its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. A list of agency FOIA Public Liaisons is available at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">http://www.foia.gov/report-makerequest.html.</inline> The CSB must also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services.

For example, under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the CSB may waive the formal certification requirement.

In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Whenever possible, the business submitter's claim of confidentiality should be supported by a statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative of the business submitter. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

                                                <content> The CSB must provide its decision on an appeal in writing. The disposition of an appeal will be in writing and will constitute the final action of the CSB on a request. A decision that upholds the CSB's determination in whole or in part will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will also inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the OGIS of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If the CSB's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the CSB must notify the requester of that determination in writing. The CSB must then further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and will respond directly to the requester.

                                                <content> The CSB must charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes three categories of requesters: Commercial use requesters, non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters, and all other requesters. Different fees are assessed depending on the category. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. The CSB must consider requests for fee waivers in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (k) of this section. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, the CSB may contact a requester for additional information. The CSB must ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. The CSB ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States, or by another method as determined by the CSB.

Accordingly, the term includes any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">news</inline> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast news to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals that disseminate news and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public, including those solely on the Internet. These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered to be news-media entities. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Freelance</inline> journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, the CSB can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. The CSB will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 1601.15, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

The CSB must honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where the CSB can readily reproduce it in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, the CSB must provide one copy per request at the cost of $0.17 per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, the CSB must charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, the CSB must charge the direct costs.

Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.

                                                <content> When the CSB reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the CSB may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The CSB may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a thirty (30) day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, the CSB must aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.

A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary <?page num="45511"?>interest furthered by the request. The CSB ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied the factors in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) administers section 340B of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), known as the “340B Drug Pricing Program” or the “340B Program.” HRSA published a final rule on <date date="2017-01-05">January 5, 2017</date>, that set forth the calculation of the ceiling price and application of civil monetary penalties. The final rule applied to all drug manufacturers that are required to make their drugs available to covered entities under the 340B Program. On <date date="2017-08-21">August 21, 2017</date>, HHS solicited comments on further delaying the effective date of the <date date="2017-01-05">January 5, 2017</date>, final rule to <date date="2018-07-01">July 1, 2018</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/82/39553">82 FR 39553</ref>). HHS proposed this action to allow a more deliberate process of considering alternative and supplemental regulatory provisions and to allow for sufficient time for additional rulemaking. After consideration of the comments received on the proposed rule, HHS is delaying the effective date of the <date date="2017-01-05">January 5, 2017</date>, final rule, to <date date="2018-07-01">July 1, 2018</date>.

HHS subsequently published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on <date date="2015-06-17">June 17, 2015</date>, to implement CMPs for manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally charge a covered entity more than the ceiling price for a covered outpatient drug; to provide clarity regarding the requirement that manufacturers calculate the 340B ceiling price on a quarterly basis; and to establish the requirement that a manufacturer charge $.01 (penny pricing) for drugs when the ceiling price calculation equals zero (<ref href="/us/fr/80/34583">80 FR 34583</ref>, <date date="2015-06-17">June 17, 2015</date>). The public comment period closed on <date date="2015-08-17">August 17, 2015</date>, and HRSA received 35 comments. After review of the initial comments, HHS reopened the comment period (<ref href="/us/fr/81/22960">81 FR 22960</ref>, <date date="2016-04-19">April 19, 2016</date>) to invite additional comments on the following areas of the NPRM: 340B ceiling price calculations that result in a ceiling price that equals zero (penny pricing); the methodology that manufacturers use when estimating the ceiling price for a new covered outpatient drug; and the definition of the “knowing and intentional” standard to be applied when assessing a CMP for manufacturers that overcharge a covered entity. The comment period closed <date date="2016-05-19">May 19, 2016</date>, and HHS received 72 comments.

The provisions of that final rule were to be effective <date date="2017-03-06">March 6, 2017</date>; however, HHS issued a subsequent final rule (<ref href="/us/fr/82/12508">82 FR 12508</ref>, <date date="2017-03-06">March 6, 2017</date>) delaying the effective date to <date date="2017-03-21">March 21, 2017</date>, in accordance with a <date date="2017-01-20">January 20, 2017</date>, memorandum from the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, titled “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review.” <ref id="fnd4e11155" idref="fnd4e11161" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref> In the <date date="2017-01-05">January 5, 2017</date>, final rule, HHS acknowledged that the effective date fell during the middle of a quarter and stakeholders needed time to adjust systems and update their policies and procedures.

The further delay allows necessary time to fully consider the substantial questions of fact, law, and policy raised by the rule, consistent with the aforementioned “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review,” memorandum. Requiring manufacturers to make targeted and potentially costly changes to pricing systems and business procedures in order to comply with a rule that is under further consideration and for which substantive questions have been raised would be disruptive. The further delay allows HHS to consider objections regarding the timing of the effective date and challenges associated with complying with the rule, as well as other objections to the rule.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s551">5 U.S.C. 551</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.</inline>) requires that Federal agencies provide at least 30 days after publication of a final rule in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> before making it effective, unless good cause can be found not to do so. HHS finds good cause for making this final rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> given that failure to do so would result in the final rule published on <date date="2017-01-05">January 5, 2017</date>, going into effect on <date date="2017-10-01">October 1, 2017</date>, for several weeks before a final rule delaying the effective date until <date date="2018-07-01">July 1, 2018</date>, would go into effect. To preclude this uncertainty in the marketplace and to ease the burdens of stakeholders, HHS believes that a clear effective date is an important goal and one that becomes particularly important when it is paired with potential civil monetary penalties. The additional time provided to the public before the rule takes effect will assist stakeholders in preparing to comply with these new program requirements.

Commenters recommended that HHS use its statutory rulemaking authority to balance the scales of enforcement and oversight in the 340B Program, and expressed concern that drug manufacturers have engaged in discriminatory pricing strategies due to <?page num="45513"?>a lack of oversight and enforcement with respect to manufacturer behavior. They explained that various factors, including extensive data regarding overcharging covered entities, HHS's inability to address overcharges, and HHS's admission that many manufacturers are still out of compliance highlight the need for the final rule to go into effect immediately. They further explained that the <date date="2017-01-05">January 5, 2017</date>, final rule is critical to ensuring that drug manufacturers uphold the intent of the 340B Program. The commenters also disagreed that “a more deliberative process is needed” as there have been multiple delays and stakeholders were given various opportunities to comment.

The final rule does not represent the only method for HHS to address manufacturer overcharges. In addition to the final rule, HHS performs audits of manufacturers, investigates all allegations of overcharging, and participates in settlements that have returned millions of dollars to covered entities. HHS believes that it would be disruptive to require stakeholders to make potentially costly changes to pricing systems and business procedures in order to comply with a rule that is under further consideration and for which substantive questions have been raised.

Section 3(f) of <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref> defines a “significant regulatory action” as an action that is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more in any 1 year, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or Tribal governments or communities (also referred to as “economically significant”); (2) creating a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.

If a rule has a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities, the Secretary must specifically consider the economic effect of the rule on small entities and analyze regulatory options that could lessen the impact of the rule. HHS will use an RFA threshold of at least a 3 percent impact on at least 5 percent of small entities.

The current SBA size standard for health care providers ranges from annual receipts of $7 million to $35.5 million. As of <date date="2017-01-01">January 1, 2017</date>, over 12,000 covered entities participate in the 340B Program, which represent safety-net health care providers across the country. HHS has determined, and the Secretary certifies that this final rule will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small manufacturers; therefore, we are not preparing an analysis of impact for this RFA. HHS estimates that the economic impact on small entities and small manufacturers will be minimal.

Applicable to the purse seine fleet fishing for tropical tunas (bigeye, yellowfin, and skipjack tuna) in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) and only for the remainder of the 2017 calendar year, the amendments to Resolution C–17–01 remove the total allowable catches (TACs) for bigeye tuna (BET) and yellowfin tuna (YFT), and replace them with an extension in the purse seine closure period from 62 days to 72 days. Additionally, to ensure that the time/area closure, known as the corralito, does not overlap with the extended closure periods, the amendments also shift the dates for the corralito closure. This rule is necessary for the conservation of tropical tuna stocks in the EPO and for the United States to satisfy its obligations as a member of the IATTC.

In 2003, the IATTC took the first step to dramatically revise the 1949 Convention by adopting the Convention for the Strengthening of the IATTC Established by the 1949 Convention between the United States of America and the Republic of Costa Rica (Antigua Convention), which did not enter into force until 2010 when the requite number of members agreed to the revisions. After the Antigua Convention had entered into force in 2010, the United States acceded to the Antigua Convention on <date date="2016-02-24">February 24, 2016</date>. The full text of the Antigua Convention is available at: <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.iattc.org/PDFFiles2/Antigua_Convention_Jun_2003.pdf.</inline>

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The IATTC consists of 21 member nations and four cooperating non-member nations and facilitates scientific research into, as well as the conservation and management of, tuna and tuna-like species in the IATTC Convention Area. The IATTC Convention Area is defined as waters of the EPO within the area bounded by the west coast of the Americas and by 50° N. latitude, 150° W. longitude, and 50° S. latitude. The IATTC maintains a scientific research and fishery monitoring program and regularly assesses the status of tuna, sharks, and billfish stocks in the EPO to determine appropriate catch limits and other measures deemed necessary to promote sustainable fisheries and prevent the overexploitation of these stocks.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The IATTC adopted Resolution C–17–02 by consensus at its 92nd meeting in July 2017. While the Resolution contains management measures for tropical tuna in the Convention Area for 2018–2020, it also contains amendments to C–17–01, which is applicable in 2017 only. The measures for 2018–2020 will be implemented in a different rulemaking. In contrast, this rule implements only the amendments to C–17–01 because they are applicable immediately and therefore need to be expeditiously implemented.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The IATTC adopted Resolution C–17–01 in February 2017. C–17–01 included a provision not previously utilized in recent IATTC resolutions: Convention Area-wide TACs for yellowfin and bigeye tuna caught by purse seine vessels. As the 92nd Meeting of the IATTC approached in July 2017, the purse seine catch levels were monitored by the IATTC staff, who notified the IATTC that the TAC for class size 4 to 6 purse seine vessels fishing on floating objects (97,711 metric tons) was near its limit. Due to the negative impacts an August closure would have on several countries, the Commission formulated an alternative solution that would relieve those social-financial impacts to industry while still protecting the stocks from overfishing. The IATTC scientific staff analyzed the conservation benefit of various alternatives for 2017 management of tropical tunas and recommended, as they had during previous meetings, extending the 62-day purse seine closure period.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Accordingly, the Commission agreed to amend C–17–01 to eliminate the TACs and extend the two closure period options from 62 days to 72 days. Two additional provisions of the amendment include:

This decision is binding under international law, and failure to ensure domestic implementation would render the nation out of compliance with our international treaty obligations, as well as failing to adequately conserve and manage target stocks of tropical tuna. Therefore, providing advance notice and consideration of public comments before implementing this decision would be impracticable because the first closed period (described above) under the existing regulations ends on <date date="2017-09-27">September 27, 2017</date>, but under the newly adopted international treaty obligations, the United States must ensure that vessels subject to that first closed period are prevented from fishing beginning on September 28 for an additional 10 days. The public interest dictates that the nation adheres to international legal obligations and continues to adequately conserve and manage tropical tunas in the Pacific. Therefore, it would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to publish a proposed rule and provide advance notice and comment before implementing the revisions to IATTC Resolution C–17–01.

Since the binding IATTC resolution makes these measures effective immediately, and the extended closure dates begin on <date date="2017-09-28">September 28, 2017</date>, this rule must be enforceable at least by that date. As explained above, this date is set in a binding resolution and cannot be changed by NMFS. Failure to implement the resolution by this date would risk putting the United States out of compliance with our international Treaty obligations, as well as failing to adequately conserve and manage tropical tuna stocks in the Pacific.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This decision proposes amendments to Marketing Order No. 989 (order), which regulates the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California and provides producers with the opportunity to vote in a referendum to determine if they favor the changes. Five amendments proposed by the Raisin Administrative Committee (RAC or Committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order, would: Authorize production research; establish new nomination procedures for independent producer member and alternate member seats; add authority to regulate quality; add authority to establish different regulations for different markets; and add a continuance referenda requirement.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposed to: Remove order language pertaining to volume regulation and reserve pool authority; establish term limits for Committee members; and, to make any such changes as may be necessary to the order to conform to any amendment that may be adopted, or to correct minor inconsistencies and typographical errors.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">These proposed amendments would update the order to reflect changes in the industry and potential future changes, and would improve the operation and administration of the order.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed amendments are based on the record of a public hearing held on May 3 and 4, 2016, in Clovis, California. The hearing was held pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (<ref href="/us/usc/t7/s601–674">7 U.S.C. 601–674</ref>), hereinafter referred to as the “Act,” and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and orders (<ref href="/us/cfr/t7/p900">7 CFR part 900</ref>). Notice of this hearing was published in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> on <date date="2016-04-22">April 22, 2016</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/81/23650">81 FR 23650</ref>). The notice of hearing contained five proposals submitted by the Committee and three proposals by USDA.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The amendments in this decision would:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(1) Authorize production research;
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(2) Establish new nomination procedures for independent producer member and alternate member seats;









 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(3) Add authority to regulate quality;
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(4) Add authority to establish different regulations for different markets;
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(5) Add a continuance referenda requirement;
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(6) Remove order language pertaining to volume regulation and reserve pool authority;
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(7) Establish term limits for Committee members; and
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(8) Make any such changes as may be necessary to the order to conform to any amendment that may be adopted, or to correct minor inconsistencies and typographical errors.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Conforming changes and corrections proposed by USDA include: Revising all references of “offgrade” to “off-grade”; revising all references of “nonnormal” to “non-normal”; and, revising all references to “committee” to “Committee”. These corrections would result in consistent spelling of these terms throughout the order.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, the words “Processed Products Standardization and Inspection Branch” in §§ 989.58(d) and 989.59(d) should be changed to “Specialty Crops Inspection Division.” Similarly, “Processed Products Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division” in <?page num="45518"?>§ 989.102 should be changed to “Specialty Crops Inspection Division.” These corrections would reflect the official name change of the AMS's inspection service office for fruit, vegetables and specialty crops.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Lastly, an additional correction has been added to change the amendatory language in § 989.55, 989.56, 989.65, 989.66, 989.67, 989.71, 989.72, 989.82, 989.154, 989.156, 989.166, 989.167, 989.221, 989.257 and 989.401, from “remove” to “delete and reserve”. This change would prevent the unintentional renumbering of remaining sections of the order.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Upon the basis of evidence introduced at the hearing and the record thereof, the Administrator of AMS on <date date="2017-05-03">May 3, 2017</date>, filed with the Hearing Clerk, USDA, a Recommended Decision and Opportunity to File Written Exceptions thereto by <date date="2017-06-30">June 30, 2017</date>. One exception was filed.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The exception filed opposed the proposed amendment to establish term limits. The commenter, representing the Raisin Bargaining Association (RBA), stated that the RBA Board of Directors voted unanimously to use the association's block voting option to vote against the term limits proposal. The commenter reasoned that the RAC has an active and diverse membership, and that current RAC meetings are well attended and benefit from membership discussions. The commenter further argued that term limits, if implemented, would limit the industry's choice as to who may represent them on the RAC and would prevent experienced persons from continuing to participate. Lastly, the commenter stated that the RAC had also unanimously voted against the term limits proposal in meetings held prior to the public hearing.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Currently, the term of office of each member and alternate member of the RAC is two years. There are no provisions related to term limits in the marketing order. USDA is proposing that members serve no more than four consecutive two-year terms, or a total of eight years. Once a member has served on the RAC for four consecutive terms, or eight years, the member could not serve as a member for at least one year before being eligible to serve again.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The USDA believes that all marketing order programs should include tenure limitations for Committee membership. Incorporating the proposed amendment into the order would uphold the intent of the 1982 <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">USDA Fruit, Vegetable and Specialty Crop Marketing Order Guidelines,</inline> which resulted from a 1981 Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief study finding that tenure should be limited. Further, if implemented, term limits would increase the number of individuals in the industry with Committee experience and provide the Committee with new perspectives and ideas. Therefore, the proposal to add a provision for term limits to the order is not removed as a result of the filed exception.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), AMS has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. Accordingly, AMS has prepared this final regulatory flexibility analysis.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesses subject to such actions so that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders and amendments thereto are unique in that they are normally brought about through group action of essentially small entities for their own benefit.








 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">According to the hearing transcript, there are approximately 3,000 raisin producers in California. According to National Agricultural Statistics Service data presented at the hearing, the total value of production of raisins in the 2014/15 crop year is $598,052,000. Taking the total value of production for raisins and dividing it by the total number of raisin producers provides an average return per producer of $199,950.67. A small producer as defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) (<ref href="/us/cfr/t13/s121.201">13 CFR 121.201</ref>) is one that grosses less than $750,000 annually. Therefore, a majority of raisin producers are considered small entities under SBA's standards.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">According to the industry, there were 23 handlers for the 2015/16 crop year. A small agricultural service firm as defined by the SBA is one that grosses less than $7,500,000 annually. Based on Committee data, 13 handlers would be considered small entities under SBA's standards. Slightly more than half of the industry's handlers are considered small entities under SBA's standards.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The production area regulated under the order covers the state of California. Acreage devoted to raisin production in the regulated area has declined in recent years. According to data presented at the hearing, bearing acreage for raisins reached a high of 280,000 acres during the 2000/01 crop year. Since then, bearing acreage for raisins has decreased 32 percent to 190,000 acres in 2014/15. As a result, the total production of raisins reached a high during the 2000/01 crop year of 484,500 tons (dried basis). Since the 2000/01 crop year, total production for raisins has decreased 32 percent to 328,600 tons in 2014/15.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">During the hearing held May 3 and 4, 2016, interested persons were invited to present evidence at the hearing on the probable regulatory and informational impact of the proposed amendments to the order on small businesses. The evidence presented at the hearing shows that none of the proposed amendments would have any burdensome effects or a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small agricultural producers or firms.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Material Issue Number 1—Authorize Production Research
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposal described in Material Issue 1 would amend § 989.53 to authorize production research.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Currently, the California Raisin Marketing Board (CRMB) is the funding source for production research for the California raisin industry. Three years ago, payments of assessments to the CRMB were suspended due to the results of litigation. Without funding the CRMB has been unable to conduct any new production research projects. If amended, this proposal would authorize the RAC to conduct production research without having to rely on the CRMB.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Witnesses supported this proposal and stated that future research could potentially impact producers in many ways, such as reducing pesticide usage or the development of new varieties that are less labor intensive. Production research would provide the raisin industry the ability to meet the needs of the ever changing domestic and international markets. According to a witness's testimony, the benefits of the proposed amendment would outweigh any costs.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For the reasons described above, it is determined that the proposed amendment would benefit industry participants and improve administration of the order. The costs of implementing this proposal would be minimal, and not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Material Issue Number 2—Authorize Separate Nominations for Independent Producer Member and Independent Producer Alternate Member Seats
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposal described in Material Issue 2 would amend §§ 989.29 and 989.129 to authorize separate nominations for independent producer members and independent producer alternate member seats.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Currently, the RAC has difficulty filling Committee seats designated for independent producer members and independent producer alternate members. Independent producer <?page num="45519"?>alternate member seats have gone unfilled for several consecutive years.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">According to witnesses' testimony, the purpose of the proposal is to increase the participation of independent producers willing to participate on the Committee. Full participation would give the independent producers their represented voice on RAC decisions.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In conclusion, it is determined that the benefits of increased Committee participation by independent producers would outweigh any costs associated with the implementation of the proposed amendment. The costs of implementing this proposal would be minimal, and would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposal described in Material Issue 3 would amend §§ 989.58, 989.59 and 989.61 to add authority to regulate quality. A corresponding change would also revise the heading prior to § 989.58 to include quality.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Currently, §§ 989.58 and 989.59 of the order state that the Committee has the authority to recommend grade and condition standards regulation under the order. The attribute “quality” is not specifically mentioned. The proposed amendment would add language to include “quality” as an attribute that can be regulated under the order.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">According to a witness, the proposed amendment would give the Committee flexibility to ensure consumer safety by setting quality standards for residue levels for herbicides, pesticides or fungicides. The quality standards would be equally applied to all handlers of raisins within the U.S.; some handlers are already testing for certain types of fungicides so the increased costs would be minimal.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">It is determined that the additional costs incurred to regulate quality would be greatly outweighed by the increased flexibility for the industry to respond to changing quality regulations, increased consumer safety, and other benefits gained from implementing this proposal. The costs of implementing this proposal would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The order does not currently allow for different quality or grade standards to be applied to different foreign markets. The language in the order only has two classifications for grade and condition standards, Grade A or Grade B. The current grade and condition standards are consistent across all markets.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed amendment would give the Committee the authority to develop regulations for individual foreign markets that would be best suited for that specific destination. This proposal would give the industry flexibility to tailor product attributes to meet the foreign consumer profile and the customer demands for each individual market.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For the reasons described above, it is determined that any additional costs incurred for this proposal would be outweighed by the increased flexibility for the industry to respond to a changing global marketplace. The costs of implementing this proposal would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposal described in Material Issue 5 would amend § 989.91 to require continuance referenda.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed amendment would require the USDA to conduct a continuance referenda between year five and year six for the first referendum and every six years thereafter to assure that the order is responsive to industry needs and changing circumstances. A witness testified that a continuance referenda is the best tool for assuring that the order remains responsive to the needs of the industry. While a continuance referenda will not directly improve producer returns, it will indirectly assure that the industry believes that the order is operating in the producer's best interest.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For these reasons, it is determined that the benefits of conducting a continuance referenda would outweigh the potential costs of implementing this proposal.

Corresponding changes would also remove the following headings: “Volume Regulation” prior to § 989.65; “Volume Regulation” prior to § 989.166; and, “Subpart-Schedule of Payments” prior to § 989.401.








 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed amendment would remove all authority for the RAC to establish volume restrictions and a reserve pool.

By a <date date="2015-07-16">July 16, 2015</date>, letter to the RAC, USDA stated, “In light of the Horne decision, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has decided not to authorize the reserve program of the Federal marketing order for California raisins for the foreseeable future, effective immediately.”
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">One witness explained that bearing acres have declined the past ten years that supports the theory that the California raisin industry is adjusting to a decreasing or flat demand for the product. The witness stated that, in the future, supply will likely remain in better balance with demand and, therefore, the reserve pool and volume regulation are no longer as relevant as they were in higher production times. To further the point, the witness stated that the order's reserve pool authority has not been utilized since 2010.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposal would be a relaxation of regulations, for this reason, it is determined that no significant impact on small business entities is anticipated from this proposed change.

Subsequent referenda to ascertain continuance shall be conducted every six crop years thereafter. The Secretary may terminate the provisions of this part at the end of any crop year in which the Secretary has found that continuance of this part is not favored by a two-thirds majority of voting producers, or a two-thirds majority of volume represented thereby, who, during a representative period determined by the Secretary, have been engaged in the production for market of grapes used in the production of raisins in the State of California. Such termination shall be announced on or before the end of the crop year.

                                             <content style="-uslm-sgm:P">Any person (defined in § 989.3 as an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or any other business unit) who is engaged, in a proprietary capacity, in the production of grapes which are sun-dried or dehydrated by artificial means to produce raisins and who qualifies under the provisions of § 989.29(b)(2) shall be eligible to cast one ballot for a nominee for each producer member position and one ballot for a nominee for each producer alternate member position on the committee which is to be filled for his district. Such person must be the one who or which: (a) Owns and farms land resulting in his or its ownership of such grapes produced thereon; (b) rents and farms land, resulting in his or its ownership of all or a portion of such grapes produced thereon; or (c) owns land which he or it does not farm and, as rental for such land, obtains the ownership of a portion of such grapes or the raisins. In this connection, a partnership shall be deemed to include two or more persons (including a husband and wife) with respect to land the title to which, or leasehold interest in which, is vested in them as tenants in common, joint tenants, or under community property laws, as community property. In a landlord-tenant relationship, wherein each of the parties is a producer, each such producer shall be entitled to one vote for a nominee for each producer member position and one vote for each producer alternate member position. Hence, where two persons operate land as landlord and tenant on a share-crop basis, each person is entitled to one vote for each such position to be filled. Where land is leased on a cash rental basis, only the person who is the tenant or cash renter (producer) is entitled to vote. A partnership or corporation, when eligible, is entitled to cast only one vote for a nominee for each producer position to be filled in its district.

Such notification shall be provided verbally or by other means of communication, including email. Natural condition raisins which have been reconditioned shall continue to be considered natural condition raisins for purposes of reinspection (inspection pursuant to § 989.58(d)) after such reconditioning has been completed, if no water or moisture has been added; otherwise, such raisins shall be considered as packed raisins. The weight of the raisins reconditioned successfully shall be determined by reweighing, except where a lot, before reconditioning, failed due to excess moisture only. The weight of such raisins resulting from reconditioning a lot failing account excess moisture may be determined by deducting 1.2 percent of the weight for each percent of moisture in excess of the allowable tolerance. When necessary due to the presence of sand, as determined by the inspection service, the requirement for deducting sand tare and the manner of its determination, as prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, shall apply in computing the net weight of any such successfully reconditioned natural condition raisins. The weight of the reconditioned raisins acquired as packed raisins shall be adjusted to natural condition weight by the use of factors applicable to the various degrees of processing accomplished. The applicable factor shall be that selected by the inspector of the reconditioned raisins from among factors established by the Committee with the approval of the Secretary.

This proposed AD would require detailed inspections of fuselage skin for the presence of scribe lines, and applicable on-condition actions. We are proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

Instead, the KPCs are collected under the Clean Diamond Trade Act (CDTA) (<ref href="/us/pl/108/19">Pub. L. 108–19</ref>, <ref href="/us/usc/t19/s3901">19 U.S.C. 3901</ref>, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.</inline>) and <ref href="/us/eo/13312">Executive Order 13312</ref>, entitled “Implementing the Clean Diamond Trade Act” (<ref href="/us/fr/68/45151">68 FR 45151</ref>, <date date="2003-07-29">July 29, 2003</date>). The CDTA and <ref href="/us/eo/13312">Executive Order 13312</ref> require that the importation into, and exportation from, the United States of any rough diamonds be controlled through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS). The KPCS calls on Participants (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.</inline> governments participating in the KPCS), including the United States, to ensure that any shipment of rough diamonds exported to, or imported from, a Participant be accompanied by a valid KPC, and maintain and publish statistics on the importation and exportation of rough diamonds. The CDTA further provides that the United States should produce statistics on imports and exports of rough diamonds and to make these statistics available for analysis by interested parties, including other governments participating in the KPCS.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Consistent with the CDTA, <ref href="/us/eo/13312">Executive Order 13312</ref>, and the KPCS, the Office of Foreign Assets Control's Rough Diamonds Control Regulations (Title <ref href="/us/cfr/t31/p592">31 CFR, part 592</ref>) require that a shipment of rough diamonds imported into, or exported from, the United States be accompanied by an original KPC, and the Census Bureau's FTR requires that KPCs for all import and export shipments be provided to the Census Bureau. The data collected from the KPCs are separate and distinct from the statistical data collected under <ref href="/us/usc/t13">Title 13 of the United States Code</ref>, and are not governed by the confidentiality provisions of that title.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Chief Counsel for Regulation of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA) that this proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Currently, a KPC must be submitted for all imports or exports of rough diamonds. This rulemaking requires that KPCs be provided to the Census Bureau immediately after either entry in or export from the United States. It replaces the previous requirement to provide the KPC to the Census Bureau in advance.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This action requires that U.S. Principal Parties in Interest (USPPIs) or authorized agents in the United States file export information to the Automated Export System (AES) for all shipments where an Electronic Export Information (EEI) record is required under the FTR. The SBA's table of size standards indicates that businesses that are the USPPI or authorized agent and file export information are considered small businesses if they employ less than 500 people. Based on Exhibit 7a of the 2015 <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Profile of U.S. Exporting Companies,</inline> the Census Bureau estimates that there are 295,000 USPPIs that are considered small business entities under the SBA definition. And more than 90 percent of these USPPIs use an authorized agent to file export information. An estimate of the number of authorized agents is not known and is unable to be determined.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Census Bureau anticipates that the clarification of requirements will not significantly affect the small businesses that file through the AES. The majority of agents require use of a computer to perform routine tasks, such as filing through the AES. These agents are unlikely to be significantly affected by these clarifications of requirements, as they already possess the necessary technology and equipment to submit the information through the AES. In addition, it is not necessary for small businesses to purchase software for this task because a free Internet-based system, AES<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Direct,</inline> is provided for the electronic submission of export information. The proposed new requirements will have minimal impact on response burden. For these reasons, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This proposed rule is not an <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref> regulatory action because this proposed rule is not significant under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This SNPRM provides interested parties the opportunity to comment on the proposed revisions to the FHWA and FTA joint regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Section 4(f) requirements. The FHWA, FRA, and FTA (hereafter referred to as “the Agencies”) propose these revisions after the enactment of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, which requires a rulemaking to address programmatic approaches in environmental reviews and makes other changes to existing law that should be addressed in a rulemaking. In this SNPRM the Agencies also propose to add FRA to regulations governing environmental impact and related procedures and the parks, recreation areas, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic site, making those regulations FRA's NEPA implementing procedures and FRA's Section 4(f) implementing regulations, respectively. This SNPRM proposes to modify the FHWA/FTA Environmental Impact and Related Procedures due to changes to the environmental review process made by the FAST Act and to modify the Parks, Recreation Areas, Wildlife and Waterfowl Refuges, and Historic Sites regulations due to new exceptions created by the FAST Act. Lastly, the Agencies request comments regarding the current FHWA and FTA definition of “existing operational right-of-way” in their respective categorical exclusion sections. The Agencies seek comments on the proposals in this document.

The FAST Act contains new requirements the Agencies must follow to comply with NEPA (<ref href="/us/usc/t42/s4321">42 U.S.C. 4321</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.</inline>) and Section 4(f) (<ref href="/us/usc/t23/s138">23 U.S.C. 138</ref> and <ref href="/us/usc/t49/s303">49 U.S.C. 303</ref>). This SNPRM includes proposed changes to <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p771">23 CFR part 771</ref> to address the following issues: (1) Section 1304(k) which requires a rulemaking regarding programmatic approaches; (2) certain amendments to <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139">23 U.S.C. 139</ref> made by section 1304; and (3) the section 11503 requirement that the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) apply, to the greatest extent feasible, the project development procedures described in <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139">23 U.S.C. 139</ref> to railroad projects requiring the Secretary's approval under NEPA (<ref href="/us/usc/t49/s24201/a">49 U.S.C. 24201(a)</ref>).

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This SNPRM supplements the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) FHWA and FTA issued on <date date="2015-11-20">November 20, 2015</date> (November 2015 NPRM) (<ref href="/us/fr/80/72624">80 FR 72624</ref>, Docket No. FHWA–2015–0011). The November 2015 NPRM proposed changes to the FHWA/FTA Environmental Impact and Related Procedures regulations (<ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p771">23 CFR part 771</ref>) and the Parks, Recreation Areas, Wildlife and Waterfowl Refuges, and Historic Site regulations (<ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p774">23 CFR part 774</ref>). Primarily, FHWA and FTA issued the November 2015 NPRM to address certain changes to the environmental review process imposed by MAP–21.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The comment period for the November 2015 NPRM closed on <date date="2016-01-19">January 19, 2016</date>. The FHWA and FTA received 14 comment letters for consideration. During the November 2015 NPRM comment period, President Obama signed the FAST Act into law. The FHWA and FTA did not pursue a final rule following the November 2015 NPRM because certain FAST Act provisions affected portions of the regulatory provisions addressed in the November 2015 NPRM and because certain other FAST Act provisions are appropriately addressed in a rulemaking. The Agencies now propose addressing those changes to parts 771 and 774 in this SNPRM.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies used the proposals in the November 2015 NPRM as the baseline for this SNPRM (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> section/paragraph organization and language). All substantive comments received on the November 2015 NPRM and this SNPRM, as well as the appropriate responses to both sets of comments, will be addressed in a final rule should a final rule be issued. The docket contains a redline that captures both the November 2015 NPRM and this SNPRM's changes.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This SNPRM contains proposals satisfying the rulemaking requirements in FAST Act sections 1304(k) and 11503, and addresses changes to <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139">23 U.S.C. 139</ref> (Efficient Environmental Reviews for Project Decisionmaking), <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s138">23 U.S.C. 138</ref> (Preservation of Parklands), and <ref href="/us/usc/t49/s303">49 U.S.C. 303</ref> (Policy on Lands, Wildlife and Waterfowl Refuges, and Historic Sites) FAST Act sections 1304, 1303, and 11502 made, respectively. The SNPRM also proposes to add FRA to parts 771 and 774.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 11503 of the FAST Act requires the Secretary, among other things, to apply, to the greatest extent feasible, the project development procedures described in <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139">23 U.S.C. 139</ref> (Efficient Environmental Reviews for Project Decisionmaking) to railroad projects requiring the Secretary's approval under NEPA. The Secretary must incorporate into FRA regulations and procedures for railroad projects aspects of the <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139">23 U.S.C. 139</ref> project development procedures, or portions thereof, that increase the efficiency of the review of railroad projects consistent with section 11503.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FRA has determined that applying <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p771">23 CFR part 771</ref> to railroad actions is the most efficient way to comply with section 11503. By joining part 771, FRA would not need to develop entirely new NEPA regulations for railroads projects. On <date date="2016-06-09">June 9, 2016</date>, FRA published a notice in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> requesting public comment on the application of part 771 to FRA's <?page num="45532"?>railroad projects (<ref href="/us/fr/81/37237">81 FR 37237</ref>, <date date="2016-06-09">June 9, 2016</date>). The comment period ended on <date date="2016-07-11">July 11, 2016</date>. The FRA received one comment on this notice from the Association of American Railroads (AAR). The commenter suggested that FRA develop its own regulations rather than adopt <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p771">23 CFR part 771</ref> because of perceived difficulties applying certain requirements to freight railroad projects on privately owned infrastructure. While many of the FHWA and FTA actions are sponsored by government entities (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> State DOTs), the regulations can be applied to the actions on privately owned railroad infrastructure. This SNPRM proposes certain modifications to <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p771">23 CFR part 771</ref> to accommodate railroad projects.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 11503 of the FAST Act also required FRA to survey its use of NEPA categorical exclusions (CE) in railroad projects since 2005. On <date date="2016-06-02">June 2, 2016</date>, FRA published a notice in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> providing the public with a review of FRA's survey, requesting comments on two new classes of actions that might be appropriate for categorical exclusion, and requesting suggestions for additional categories of activities appropriate for exclusion (<ref href="/us/fr/81/35437">81 FR 35437</ref>, <date date="2016-06-02">June 2, 2016</date>) (June Notice). The comment period ended on <date date="2016-07-05">July 5, 2016</date>. The FRA received comments from the AAR, the Michigan Department of Transportation and the Oregon Department of Transportation which are addressed in the section-by-section analysis below. This SNPRM satisfies the FAST Act section 11503 requirement that the Secretary publish an NPRM proposing new and existing CEs for railroad projects requiring the Secretary's approval.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FRA proposes to join the <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p774">23 CFR part 774</ref> regulations implementing Section 4(f). FRA determined joining <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p774">23 CFR part 774</ref> would further align its environmental review processes with the FHWA and FTA processes. This would create consistency implementing Section 4(f) and provide clarity to FRA's applicants and project sponsors. Additionally, it eliminates FRA's need to update the Section 4(f) sections of its existing Environmental Procedures; if FRA only joined <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p771">23 CFR part 771</ref>, the part 771 regulations would supersede most, if not all, of FRA's Environmental Procedures, and FRA would still need to revise the Section 4(f) sections. In addition, FRA currently follows <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p774">23 CFR part 774</ref> and associated FHWA and FTA guidance as guidance when it applies Section 4(f) to railroad projects and officially joining the regulations would not significantly change FRA's current practice. In the future, DOT may consider proposing a Department-wide rule or updating Department-wide guidance on the implementation of Section 4(f).

First, the Agencies propose to list the Agencies in alphabetical order (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> “FHWA, FRA, and FTA”) whenever it is necessary to list all three agencies. This change would apply throughout the regulation. Second, the Agencies propose “final EIS” as the acronym for “final environmental impact statement” (instead of “FEIS”) throughout <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p771">23 CFR part 771</ref> to provide consistency.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies propose to modify this section to add the appropriate references to FRA and railroad projects, which would allow FRA to use part 771 as its procedures for implementing NEPA. The Agencies also propose updating the list of references in the last sentence to remove MAP–21 section 1319 because it was codified at <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139/n">23 U.S.C. 139(n)</ref> and <ref href="/us/usc/t49/s304a">49 U.S.C. 304a</ref>, and to add FAST Act section 1304.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Through the November 2015 NPRM, FHWA and FTA proposed several revisions to <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p771">23 CFR part 771</ref> to satisfy the programmatic approaches rulemaking requirement created by MAP–21, section 1305. To satisfy the programmatic approaches rulemaking requirement created by FAST Act, section 1304(k), the Agencies propose revising paragraph (b), originally proposed in the November 2015 NPRM, by including the parenthetical “(including the requirements found at <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139/b">23 U.S.C. 139(b)</ref>)” after the words “environmental requirements.”
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies also propose a non-substantive change to paragraph (e)(2) in the first sentence to correct a typo (“fo” to “of”).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies are proposing to revise § 771.105 to directly address <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139/d/8">23 U.S.C. 139(d)(8)</ref>-Single NEPA Document, which requires the Agencies develop a single NEPA document that can be used for all Federal permits and reviews for a project to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with Federal law. The Agencies propose revising paragraph (a) by replacing “to the fullest extent possible” with “to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with Federal law” to reflect <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139/d/8">23 U.S.C. 139(d)(8)</ref> language. The policy statement applies broadly to the environmental review process and specifically encourages all environmental reviews and requirements (including permits) be addressed in a single process and environmental review document.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies propose to modify three definitions to add FRA's railroad projects. Specifically, the Agencies propose adding “railroad” projects, “FRA,” and “rulemakings” to the list of examples of major Federal actions in the definition of “Action,” and the Agencies propose adding “FRA” in all locations where FHWA and FTA are listed in the definition of “Administration.” The Agencies also propose similar changes to the definition of “Administration action” by adding “FRA” approval, and “rulemakings” to the list of activities needing Agency approval.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In paragraph (a)(1), the Agencies propose to clarify that the part 771 regulations and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations (<ref href="/us/cfr/t40/p1500">40 CFR parts 1500</ref>–1508) apply where one of the Agencies exercises sufficient control to condition an approval, not just a “permit or project approval,” by including “other” prior to “approvals” (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> “. . . condition the permit, project, or other approvals”). The Agencies are proposing this change to accommodate FRA's potential actions related to its safety programs.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies are not proposing to modify paragraph (a)(3) to specifically address when the regulations would apply to FRA projects. The FRA would apply these regulations to projects initiated (through publishing a notice of intent for an environmental impact statement or determining to initiate an environmental assessment) after the Agencies issue a final rule, if one is issued. Until such time, FRA will continue to follow its Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts (Environmental Procedures) (<ref href="/us/fr/64/28545">64 FR 28545</ref>, <date date="1999-05-26">May 26, 1999</date>, updated <ref href="/us/fr/78/2713">78 FR 2713</ref>, <date date="2013-01-14">Jan. 14, 2013</date>). However, as required by the FAST Act, FRA will also follow the project development procedures described in <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139">23 U.S.C. 139</ref> for its railroad projects initiated after <date date="2015-12-04">December 4, 2015</date> unless the project is subject to a funding arrangement under <?page num="45533"?>title 49, U.S.C. the Secretary approved before <date date="2015-12-04">December 4, 2015</date>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In paragraph (b)(1), the Agencies propose to add “FRA” as an agency that will assure implementation of committed mitigation measures by including the mitigation measures by reference in the grant agreement, followed by reviews of design and construction inspections.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In paragraph (c)(2), FRA added reference to FRA's financial assistance programs.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In paragraph (c)(7), the Agencies propose several revisions to reflect changes to participating agencies' responsibilities under section 1304 of the FAST Act, codified at <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139/c/6">23 U.S.C. 139(c)(6)</ref>, (d)(9), (f)(4), and (g)(1). Section 139(c)(6)(C) requires the lead agency consider and respond to comments within a participating agency's special expertise or jurisdiction. Similarly, section 139(d)(9) requires participating agencies to provide comments, responses, studies, or methodologies within the agency's special expertise or jurisdiction, and to use the process to address its environmental issues of concern. Section 139(f)(4)(A)(ii) mandates participating agencies limit their agency's comments to the subject matter areas within their agency's special expertise or jurisdiction, to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with Federal law. Lastly, section 139(g)(1)(B) now requires the coordination plan that the lead agency develops under <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139">23 U.S.C. 139</ref> include a schedule, which must receive participating agency concurrence.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In response to these changes to <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139">23 U.S.C. 139</ref>, the Agencies propose adding that participating agencies are responsible for providing input within their agency's special expertise or jurisdiction and providing concurrence on the schedule that now must be included in the coordination plan. The Agencies propose paragraph (c)(7) reads as set out in the regulatory text below. The Agencies interpret the proposed language “providing input, as appropriate” to include the requirement at <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139/d/9">23 U.S.C. 139(d)(9)</ref> that participating agencies' input include “comments, responses, studies, or methodologies on those areas within the special expertise or jurisdiction of the agency” and, therefore, did not specifically list those activities in this paragraph or elsewhere in the regulation. The Agencies determined that listing those four specific activities is unnecessarily limiting and could lead a project sponsor to believe an unlisted method of providing input is not permitted.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies further propose adding a new paragraph (e), which describes FRA's requirements for third party contracting where the project sponsor is a private entity and there is no qualified applicant as defined in § 771.107. In that situation, FRA proposes to require third party contracting for all EISs and may also require them for EAs. When using a third party contract, the project sponsor retains a contractor to assist FRA in conducting the environmental review, and the contractor works under the direction, supervision and control of FRA. A third party contracting structure would be memorialized in a memorandum of understanding among FRA, the contractor, and the project sponsor. This paragraph is intended to ensure compliance with FRA's responsibilities for EIS preparation in the CEQ implementing regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s1506.5/c">40 CFR 1506.5(c)</ref>.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies propose an associated change to the beginning of paragraph (b)(6), which addresses the role of a project sponsor that is a private entity. The proposed change reads, “Subject to paragraph (e).”

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies propose several additions to § 771.111 to reflect various FAST Act changes to <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139">23 U.S.C. 139</ref>. To reflect planning and environmental tools not previously listed, the Agencies propose adding references to <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139/f">23 U.S.C. 139(f)</ref> (Purpose and need; alternatives analysis) and <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s169">23 U.S.C. 169</ref> (Development of programmatic mitigation plans) to the list in paragraph (a)(2)(i). Section 139(f)(4)(E) of title <ref href="/us/usc/t23">23 U.S.C. </ref>establishes a new process for reducing duplication between the planning and NEPA evaluation of alternatives processes by eliminating planning alternatives from detailed consideration under NEPA when certain conditions are met. Section 169 of title <ref href="/us/usc/t23">23 U.S.C. </ref>includes an optional framework for creating programmatic mitigation plans during the transportation planning process, and gives substantial weight to programmatic mitigation plans in the environmental review process. Note that a recent final rule (<ref href="/us/fr/81/34049">81 FR 34049</ref>, <date date="2016-05-27">May 27, 2016</date>; Docket No. FHWA–2013–0037) modified <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p450">23 CFR part 450</ref>, which implements <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s168">23 U.S.C. 168</ref> and 169. Please visit the docket for more information regarding specific changes to the planning and environmental linkages processes. The Agencies also added “as applicable” to paragraph (a)(2)(i) to acknowledge the three Agencies may have different processes or requirements authorized by statute among themselves. For example, <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139">23 U.S.C. 139</ref> applies to FRA, but <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s168">23 U.S.C. 168</ref> does not.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies propose adding the requirement that a lead agency, in consultation with participating agencies, will develop an environmental checklist, as appropriate, to assist in resource and agency identification to the end of paragraph (a)(3) to reflect the new environmental checklist language found at <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139/e/5">23 U.S.C. 139(e)(5)</ref>. The Agencies interpret the statutory language in <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139/e/5/A">23 U.S.C. 139(e)(5)(A)</ref> (“The lead agency for a project . . . shall develop, as appropriate, a checklist to help project sponsors identify potential natural, cultural, and historic resources . . . .”) as providing flexibility through the phrase “as appropriate.” The Agencies are, therefore, proposing “will develop an environmental checklist, as appropriate” to reflect the statutory flexibility that allows lead agencies, including project sponsors, to develop environmental checklists when needed to facilitate the environmental process.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies propose renumbering existing paragraph (b) as (b)(1) and adding a new paragraph (b)(2). Proposed paragraph (b)(2) would state that for projects to be evaluated with an EIS, the Administration will respond in writing to a project sponsor's formal project notification within 45 days of receipt. This to respond to the new “review of application” paragraph at <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139/e/3">23 U.S.C. 139(e)(3)</ref>, which builds off the existing project notification process established under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy of Users (SAFETEA–LU). The Agencies identify EISs in the proposed language because the procedures outlined in <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139">23 U.S.C. 139</ref> are “applicable to all projects for which an [EIS] is prepared under [NEPA]” (<ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139/b/1">23 U.S.C. 139(b)(1)</ref>). The Agencies may apply the section 139 procedures to other classes of projects on a case-by-case basis but section 139 is only required for EISs, and the Agencies want to underscore that fact.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In paragraph (c), the Agencies propose adding that a project sponsor may request the Secretary to designate the lead Federal agency when project elements fall within multiple DOT agencies' expertise. This addition responds to <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139/e/4">23 U.S.C. 139(e)(4)</ref>, but adds clarity regarding the provision's applicability. In most instances, the Agencies expect project sponsors will continue to contact FHWA, FRA, or FTA to determine the Federal lead agency, as is current practice.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies propose building on the existing language regarding cooperating <?page num="45534"?>and participating agency invitations in paragraph (d) by adding timing language for those agencies' identification. The Agencies would require that the lead agencies identify participating agencies within 45 days from publication of the notice of intent at the end of paragraph (d) to address the new requirement to identify participating agencies within 45 days at <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s139/d/2">23 U.S.C. 139(d)(2)</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies propose adding a reference to FRA programs to paragraph (i) and its subordinate paragraphs, clarifying that FRA is adopting the approach that applicants in FTA's capital assistance programs use to engage the public. The Agencies also propose to add a reference to “the scope of the NEPA analysis” as an issue that the public or agencies might comment on during the 30-day period following the publication of a Notice of Intent.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Additionally, the Agencies propose replacing “NEPA documents” with “environmental documents” in paragraph (i)(3) to be consistent with <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s1508.10">40 CFR 1508.10</ref>. CEQ uses the term “environmental document” to refer to EIS, EA, finding of no significant impact, and record of decision documents broadly, which also is the Agencies' intent in paragraph (i)(3).

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies propose to add paragraph (d)(4), which would create an FRA-specific exemption to the paragraph (a)(1) prohibition on proceeding with final design activities, property acquisition, purchase of construction materials or rolling stock, or project construction until the NEPA process is complete. The proposal is consistent with FRA policy and allows FRA to makes certain case-by-case exceptions for the purchase of railroad components or materials that can be used in other projects or resold. This is not a blanket exemption, and FRA would make case-by-case determinations based on the information available at the time to ensure such activities would not improperly influence the outcome of the NEPA process.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In paragraph (a)(4), the Agencies propose to change “highway facility” to “transportation right-of-way” for consistency in this section and across modes. This change is not meant to change the meaning of the term.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies propose to add a new § 771.116. Although the Agencies collectively propose to add this section, the development of the proposed CEs for each Agency is based on each Agency's particular mission and programs, unique experiences, and existing lists of CEs. As a result, this section focuses on FRA's proposed CEs. One commenter suggests that DOT have one uniform set of CEs and identified specific FHWA CEs that FRA should adopt for its railroad projects. Typically, DOT operating administrations (OA) identify categories of actions appropriate for categorical exclusion based on the individual OA's experience. The FRA has identified and substantiated this proposed list of CEs based on its experience with these categories of actions. However, since many of the FHWA, FRA, and FTA actions are often similar, the actions may be covered in each OA's CE list but with appropriate differences reflecting the experiences of the OAs. Additionally, <ref href="/us/usc/t49/s304">49 U.S.C. 304</ref> authorizes the use by one OA of another OA's CE in certain multimodal situations.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Paragraph (a) of this section proposes to adopt the current text of §§ 771.117(a) and 771.118(a), as modified to apply to FRA. This proposed paragraph would define a CE as an action meeting the definition in the CEQ regulation and, based on FRA's past experience, does not involve significant environmental impacts. Paragraph (b) of this section proposes to describe the circumstances FRA would use to determine whether an activity, normally meeting the requirements of a CE, would require further environmental study. The FRA's proposal to adopt the FTA and FHWA list of unusual circumstances addresses a comment recommending FRA redraft its existing list of circumstances requiring further environmental study (Environmental Procedures, section 4(e)). Proposed paragraph (b) clearly articulates the circumstances requiring further environmental study for FRA's railroad projects and provides consistency with FHWA and FTA.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">One commenter suggests FRA identify a subset of CEs that require documentation and those that do not need “further NEPA approvals by FRA.” The FRA understands this comment as a suggestion to adopt a “(c)” and “(d)” list similar to those used by FHWA and FTA. The FRA considered this approach but does not propose to distinguish between different classes of CEs and will instead continue to use one comprehensive list and decide the appropriate standards for documentation on a project-by-project basis.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Paragraph (c) of this section proposes to include the activities for categorical exclusion. The proposed list of activities in paragraph (c) is based on the CEs identified in FRA's Environmental Procedures, including those CEs added in 2013. Since 2013, FRA has conducted an internal review of its CEs to ensure their continued appropriate use and usefulness. Based on FRA's internal review and the comments received on the June Notice, paragraph (c) of this section proposes to make minor edits to several of the existing CEs; to eliminate unnecessary or duplicative CEs; and to add two new CEs.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Support for FRA's proposals is included in a CE substantiation document. The CE substantiation document relies on internal FRA expert opinion, FRA's experience managing projects and other activities related to railroad safety and infrastructure development, and FRA's review of similar CEs used by other DOT OAs and other Federal agencies (often referred to as “comparative benchmarking”). For additional information, including a description of the CEs FRA proposes to eliminate, please see the CE substantiation document, which FRA has included in the docket for public review. The following discussion focuses on the proposed new CEs and those FRA proposes to modify.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Paragraph (c) proposes no changes to the following CEs (as compared to FRA's current Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts): Paragraph (c)(2) covering personnel actions; paragraph (c)(6) covering rulemakings issued under section 17 of the Noise Control Act of 1972; paragraph (c)(8) covering hearings, meetings, or public affairs activities; <?page num="45535"?>paragraph (c)(16) covering alterations to existing facilities, locomotives, stations, and rail cars to make them accessible for the elderly and persons with disabilities; paragraph (c)(19) covering the installation, repair and replacement of equipment and small structures designed to promote transportation safety, security, accessibility, communication or operational efficiency; paragraph (c)(22) covering the assembly or construction of facilities or stations; and paragraph (c)(23) covering track and track structure maintenance and improvements.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed paragraph (c)(1) provides a CE addressing administrative procurements, contracts for personal services, and training. Proposed paragraph (c)(3) modifies an existing FRA CE by adding “training” to the list of covered activities.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed paragraph (c)(3) provides a CE addressing planning or design activities that do not commit FRA to a particular course of action affecting the environment. Proposed paragraph (c)(3) is a modification of an existing FRA CE as it eliminates the limitation that the planning or design activity must be funded through FRA's financial assistance or FRA's own procurement process.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed paragraph (c)(4) provides a CE addressing localized geotechnical and other investigations that provide information for preliminary design and for environmental analyses and permitting purposes, such as: Drilling test bores for soil sampling; archeological investigations for archeology resources assessment or similar survey; and wetland surveys. This proposed CE covers investigations and surveys that inform environmental analyses and preliminary engineering for rail projects. These activities include geotechnical, geophysical, and other subsurface investigations, pedestrian and ground disturbing archaeological surveys and testing to determine eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places, and wetland surveys for purposes of wetland delineation or jurisdictional determinations. In FRA's experience, the impacts of these activities are generally minor in nature and any impacts are localized to the investigation or survey sites. This CE is consistent with existing FHWA and FTA CEs at <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/s771.117/c/24">23 CFR 771.117(c)(24)</ref> and <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/s771.118/c/16">23 CFR 771.118(c)(16)</ref>, respectively. FRA identified these activities as potentially appropriate for categorical exclusion in the June Notice. The FRA received one comment supporting this CE.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed paragraph (c)(5) provides a CE addressing internal orders, policies, and procedures that FRA is not required to publish in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> under the Administrative Procedure Act, <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s552/a/1">5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)</ref>. This proposed CE is similar to an existing FRA CE. However, proposed paragraph (c)(5) would add “policies” to the list of activities covered by the CE.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed paragraph (c)(7) provides a CE addressing the provision of financial assistance for a project where the financial assistance would fund a completed activity. For example, FRA may be involved in projects where an applicant requests financial assistance to refinance a loan. In that case, the agency's decision is merely a financial transaction that would not itself lead to any environmental impacts. The FRA identified these activities as potentially being appropriate for categorical exclusion in the June Notice. FRA received one comment supporting this CE.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed paragraph (c)(9) provides a CE addressing maintenance or repair of existing railroad equipment. The proposed CE is a modified version of an existing FRA CE. Specifically, paragraph (c)(9) would move the phrase “existing railroad facilities” to the beginning of the CE. This clarifies that the list including equipment; track and bridge structures; and electrification, communication, signaling or security facilities are non-exclusive examples of existing railroad facilities. Paragraph (c)(9) would also clarify the scope of the CE to include “repair” activities. In FRA's experience, the scope of the potential impacts resulting from repair activities is generally similar to those that might occur during routine maintenance. The primary difference between the two is that unlike maintenance, repair activities may not occur on a regular or reoccurring basis. Paragraph (c)(9) would also remove the definition of maintenance because it is unnecessary. One commenter suggests modifying paragraph (c)(9) to add a reference to right-of-way in the definition of “maintenance.” However, this modification is unnecessary since FRA's proposal would eliminate the definition of maintenance.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed paragraph (c)(10) provides a CE addressing the emergency repair or replacement of an essential rail facility damaged by a natural disaster or catastrophic failure. This proposed CE is similar to an existing FRA CE; however, proposed paragraph (c)(10) would clarify that repairs following an emergency are also covered by the CE; define repair and replacement to include reconstruction, restoration, or retrofitting; clarify that when conducting the repair and replacement, the rail facility may be upgraded as necessary to meet existing codes and standards; remove the unnecessary limitation that the CE apply only to “temporary” replacements; and remove the reference to the immediacy of the repairs in relation to the disaster or catastrophic failure. One commenter suggests that FRA adopt the “emergency repairs” CE applied by FHWA and FTA at <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/s771.117/c/9">23 CFR 771.117(c)(9)</ref> and <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/s771.118/c/11">23 CFR 771.118(c)(11)</ref>, respectively. In this SNPRM, FRA proposes modifications to its existing emergency repair CE, including the incorporation of relevant language and concepts from <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/s771.117/c/9">23 CFR 771.117(c)(9)</ref> and <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/s771.118/c/11">23 CFR 771.118(c)(11)</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed paragraph (c)(11) provides a CE addressing operating assistance to a railroad to continue existing service or an increase in service to meet demand. This proposed CE is similar to an existing FRA CE. The existing CE applies if the assistance will not result in a change in the impact or effect to the environment whereas proposed paragraph (c)(11) would modify the CE to focus on whether the project would result in significant changes to traffic density. The FRA finds focusing on change in traffic density for a CE covering operating assistance is more appropriate than the current imprecise limitation that the assistance will not result in a change in the effect on the environment.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">One commenter suggests revising proposed paragraph (c)(12) by removing the word “minor” before “rail line additions,” adding the phrase “or within existing right-of-way,” and modifying the CE's limitations by adding the requirement that the project can be constructed in less than 6 months and substantially within the existing right-of-way, and will not have additional significant environmental impacts beyond the existing rail yard or existing right-of-way. The FRA will not adopt the suggested change to remove “minor” because FRA cannot substantiate such an expansion of the CE. However, FRA proposes to adopt the suggested phrase “or within existing right-of-way” since it is consistent with the current scope of the CE and appropriately limits construction to within the existing right-of-way. The FRA also proposes to keep its existing limitations (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> “[the] additions are not inconsistent with existing zoning, do not involve acquisition of a significant amount of right-of-way, and do not significantly alter the traffic density characteristics of the existing rail lines or rail facilities.”) which are consistent with FRA's experience with railroad projects rather than adopt the <?page num="45536"?>commenter's suggestion which unnecessarily narrows the applicability of the CE.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed paragraph (c)(13) provides a CE addressing the acquisition, transfer and right to use real property and certain railroad infrastructure. The proposed CE would modify an existing version of this FRA CE by eliminating the reference to “existing railroad equipment” because acquisition of equipment would be covered by the CE proposed in paragraph (c)(18). Proposed paragraph (c)(13) also would allow the acquisition of “real property.” The FRA proposes this addition because acquisition alone does not impact the environment. In addition, the proposed CE would move the phrase “existing railroad facilities” to the beginning of the CE to clarify that the list including equipment; track and bridge structures; and electrification, communication, signaling or security facilities are non-exclusive examples of existing railroad facilities. This is also consistent with the proposed structure of paragraph (c)(9). The proposed paragraph (c)(13) would also add “transfer” to the list of covered activities to accommodate potential FRA involvement in the transfer of real property or existing railroad facilities. This is consistent with an FTA CE at <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/s771.118/c/6">23 CFR 771.118(c)(6)</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed paragraph (c)(14) provides a CE addressing research, development, and demonstration activities. This proposed CE is similar to an existing FRA CE. However, proposed paragraph (c)(14) would expand the scope of the existing CE to include research, development, and demonstration activities beyond the development of signal, communication, or train control systems. While in the past this CE was almost exclusively used for the testing of train control systems, including Positive Train Control, FRA funds other research, development, and demonstration activities similar in scope, but involving different rail systems or infrastructure, are also appropriate for categorical exclusion.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed paragraph (c)(15) provides a CE addressing the promulgation of rules, the issuance of policy statements, the waiver of modification of existing regulatory requirements, and discretionary approvals. This proposed CE is similar to an existing FRA CE; however, proposed paragraph (c)(15) would add the waiver or modification of existing regulatory requirements and discretionary approvals, and remove the limitation that these activities be related to railroad safety. This proposed CE would retain the existing limitation for increases in environmental impacts and would not be used if FRA finds the activity would significantly increase emissions of air or water pollutants or noise. However, FRA proposes striking the clause in the existing CE reading “or increased traffic congestion in any mode of transportation.”






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed paragraph (c)(17) provides a CE addressing rehabilitation, reconstruction, removal, construction, or replacement of bridges. This proposed CE is similar to an existing FRA CE but adds “removal” of bridges to the scope of covered activities. The FRA finds it is sometimes necessary to remove old railroad bridges without simultaneously building a new bridge. In those cases, the removal of the bridge is not substantially different then construction, rehabilitation, or replacement activities and would have similar types of impacts. The FRA is also proposing minor edits to the existing FRA CE for clarity.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed paragraph (c)(18) addresses acquisition, rehabilitation, transfer, or maintenance of vehicles or equipment. The proposed CE is similar to an existing FRA CE but moves the examples of vehicles and equipment to precede the CE's proposed limitation. The FRA also proposes to focus the CE's limitation on whether the activity significantly alters the traffic density characteristics of an existing rail line rather than whether the activity causes a substantial increase in the use of infrastructure within the existing right-of-way. This proposed change will create consistency with other FRA CEs.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed paragraph (c)(20) provides a CE addressing environmental restoration, remediation and pollution prevention activities. This proposed CE is similar to an existing FRA CE. However, proposed paragraph (c)(20) would remove the limitation that activities occur “in or proximate to existing and former railroad track, infrastructure, stations, or facilities.” In many cases, environmental restoration and natural resource management activities do not occur in close proximity to existing or former railroad track, infrastructure, stations, or facilities. Instead, these activities—including mitigation—must frequently be located to optimize the ecological value or benefit of the activity and are sited in consultation with, or at the direction of, various permitting agencies.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">One commenter suggests FRA adopt a number of existing FHWA CEs from the “(c)-list” with minor modifications to accommodate railroad projects. Most of the activities covered by the identified FHWA CEs are already included in one or more of FRA's proposed CEs. With respect to the FHWA CEs identified by the commenter, the activities described in § 771.117(c)(7) (landscaping) and § 771.117(c)(6) (installation of noise barriers or alternations to existing publically owned buildings to provide for noise reduction) are included in the non-exclusive list of activities in proposed paragraph (c)(20); the activities described in § 771.117(c)(8)) (installation of fencing, signs, pavement markings, small passenger shelters, traffic signals, and railroad warning devises where no substantial land acquisition or traffic disruption will occur) and § 771.117(c)(27) (highway safety or traffic operations improvement projects, including the installation of ramp metering control devices and lighting, if the project meets the constraints in paragraph (e) of the section) are included in proposed paragraph (c)(19); the activities described in § 771.117(c)(14)) (bus and rail car rehabilitation), 
§ 771.117(c)(17) (the purchase of vehicles where the use of the vehicles can be accommodated by existing facilities or new facilities which themselves are within a CE), and § 771.117(c)(19) (purchase and installation of operating or maintenance equipment to be located within the transit facility and with no significant impacts off the site) are covered by proposed FRA CE paragraph (c)(18); the activities described in § 771.117(c)(18) (track and rail bed maintenance and improvements when carried out within the existing right-of-way) are covered by proposed paragraph (c)(22); and the activities described in § 771.117(c)(28) (bridge rehabilitation, reconstruction, or replacement or the construction of grade separation to replace existing at-grade railroad crossings, if the actions meet the constraints in paragraph (e) of the section) are covered by proposed paragraph (c)(17).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The same commenter also suggests FRA adopt § 771.117(c)(2) (approval of utility installations along or across a transportation facility). At this time and based on FRA's experience, FRA does not have a sufficient need for a CE addressing utility installations. To the extent utility work is being completed as part of an FRA action, the work is typically incidental to a railroad project and as such is generally analyzed in an environmental document (which may be a CE if appropriate) for that project. The commenter also suggests FRA adopt § 771.117(d)(1) (modernization of a highway by resurfacing, restoration, rehabilitation, reconstruction, adding shoulders, or adding auxiliary lanes (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.</inline> parking, weaving, turning, climbing)). The FRA is proposing CEs similar in scope but directly applicable to railroad <?page num="45537"?>projects (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> proposed paragraphs (c)(9) and (22)).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">One commenter suggests FRA modify paragraph (c)(16) to allow alterations to existing facilities, locomotives, stations, and rail cars even where the alterations are not for the purpose of making them accessible for the elderly and persons with disabilities. This modification would change the scope of the CE FRA added in 2013 based on FRA's experience with projects intended to improve accessibility. However, FRA notes that these same activities may be covered by another FRA CE (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> proposed paragraph (c)(18)).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">One commenter suggests FRA adopt one FHWA “(d)-list” CE modified slightly to accommodate railroad projects. Specifically, the commenter suggests FRA adopt § 771.117(d)(8) (construction of new bus storage and maintenance facilities in areas used predominantly for industrial or transportation purposes where such construction is not inconsistent with existing zoning and located on or near a street with adequate capacity to handle anticipated bus and support vehicle traffic). These activities are included in proposed paragraph (c)(21).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">One commenter asks FRA to address the authority provided by MAP–21 section 1308 and FAST Act section 1315 allowing State DOTs to enter into agreements with FHWA to make CE determinations on FHWA's behalf. The FRA does not have the legal authority to participate in this program and will therefore not include it in this section. The same commenter suggests that FRA address <ref href="/us/usc/t49/s304">49 U.S.C. 304</ref>, Application of Categorical Exclusions for Multimodal Projects. That section does not create new CEs but rather sets up a process by which OAs can use the CEs of another OA under certain multimodal project circumstances. Since this process applies to all OAs, not just the Agencies, it is appropriately addressed by separate guidance, likely issued by DOT's Office of the Secretary, and not in this SNPRM.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">One commenter also asked that FRA apply its CEs less strictly and exercise more flexibility in considering which projects qualify as a CE. The FRA will continue to review each FRA action on an individual basis to ensure the action meets the definition of one or more FRA CEs and does not involve circumstances requiring further environmental study. Where there are unusual circumstances present, FRA will, in cooperation with the applicant, conduct appropriate environmental studies to determine whether application of the CE is still proper.

In those situations, this paragraph would give FRA the discretion to require the project sponsor to procure and use a third party contractor, as described in § 771.109(e), to prepare the EA. The Agencies also propose to add a requirement for contractors to execute a conflict of interest disclosure statement similar to the language in paragraph (a)(2) (previously proposed paragraph (a)(ii)), applicable to FTA projects and which FHWA and FTA proposed in the November 2015 NPRM.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Paragraph (a) is an exception from the Section 4(f) process for projects involving work on a transportation facility that is itself historic. This exception reflects the Agencies' longstanding policy that when a project involves a historic facility that is already dedicated to a transportation purpose and does not adversely affect the historic qualities of that facility, then the project does not “use” the facility within the meaning of Section 4(f). The exception applies to all types of transportation facilities, including elements, structures, and features of a highway, transit, or rail facility.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the FAST Act, Congress created two new exceptions from Section 4(f) for historic transportation facilities in certain circumstances. The Agencies propose to amend paragraph (a) to incorporate the new exceptions. Specifically, the Agencies propose to incorporate the two new exceptions from the Section 4(f) process for historic transportation facilities by renumbering paragraph (a) as paragraph (a)(3) and adding new paragraphs (a)(1) and (2). The Agencies propose to add to paragraph (a) the introductory phrase “the use of historic transportation facilities in certain circumstances:” to match the other existing exceptions in section 774.13.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies interpret the words “improvements to” in section 11502 as inclusive of the other activities listed in section 11502: Maintenance, rehabilitation, or operation of railroad or rail transit lines. For clarity, the Agencies expanded the list of examples of activities that may occur on elements of railroad or rail transit lines that may improve the transportation function of those railroad and rail transit lines. The Agencies believe that preservation, modernization, reconstruction, and replacement of an element of a historic transportation facility are types of “improvements” to railroad and rail transit lines and thus propose to include these activities in the exception. The Agencies further believe that any type of safety improvement to a highway crossing of an active railroad or transit line—whether at grade or grade separated—should be considered an “improvement to” the railroad or transit line by virtue of making travel safer for the public, and thus would be covered by the new exception.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">While the Agencies chose not to further define the terms “railroad or rail transit lines or elements thereof” within the regulation text, they view these terms as including all elements related to the historic or current transportation function such as railroad or rail transit track, elevated support structures, rights-of-way, substations, communication devices, and maintenance facilities. The Agencies do not propose to include historic sites unrelated to transportation but located within or adjacent to railroads or rail transit lines, or elements thereof in this exception. Examples of such exclusions include archeological sites unrelated to railroad or rail transit and sites of traditional religious and cultural importance to Indian tribes.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Per section 11502 of the FAST Act, all stations, and certain bridges and tunnels, are not included in the proposed paragraph (a)(2) exception. Specifically, bridges and tunnels on railroad lines that have been abandoned, as determined by the Surface Transportation Board through the process described in <ref href="/us/cfr/t49/p1152">49 CFR part 1152</ref>, are not included in the proposed exception, except for bridges and tunnels on railroads that have been railbanked, as defined in <ref href="/us/usc/t16/s1247/d">16 U.S.C. 1247(d)</ref> or otherwise preserved for future transportation use. In addition, the Agencies are proposing that bridges and tunnels on rail transit lines that are not in use and over which regular service has never operated are not included in the exception.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed new paragraph (a)(3) reads as set out in the regulatory text below. This paragraph mirrors existing § 774.13(a). The Agencies are not proposing to change the short list of activities: “restoration, rehabilitation, or maintenance” that are included in the existing regulatory text now located under paragraph (a)(3), but the Agencies specifically request that commenters consider whether the list of covered activities should be expanded to mirror the activities included in paragraph (a)(2) which is proposed to read: “maintenance, preservation, rehabilitation, operation, modernization, reconstruction, and replacement.” Under this option, there would still be two important conditions for the exception to apply under paragraph (a)(3): The Agencies must determine through a Section 106 consultation that the work would not adversely affect the historic qualities of the historic transportation facility that cause it to be listed on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places and the official(s) with jurisdiction must not object to that determination. Having the same list of activities in both subparagraphs is desirable because it would simplify administration of the exception. The Agencies seek comment, including examples, regarding whether the two conditions in paragraph (a)(3) would adequately protect significant historic transportation facilities in the case of projects to operate, modernize, reconstruct or replace the transportation facility.

Specifically, the Agencies are proposing to add a reference to high-speed ground transportation projects having moderate noise impacts according to FRA's established high-speed ground transportation noise and vibration guidelines.

The Agencies have determined preliminarily that this action would not be a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref> and would not be significant within the meaning of U.S. Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (<ref href="/us/fr/44/11032">44 FR 11032</ref>). <ref href="/us/eo/13563">Executive Order 13563</ref> emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and promoting flexibility.

The DOT Order requires DOT agencies to address compliance with the Executive Order and the DOT Order in all rulemaking activities. In addition, FHWA and FTA have issued additional documents relating to administration of the Executive Order and the DOT Order. On <date date="2012-06-14">June 14, 2012</date>, FHWA issued an update to its EJ order, FHWA Order 6640.23A, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">FHWA Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low Income Populations</inline> (available online at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">www.fhwa.dot.gov/legsregs/directives/orders/664023a.cfm</inline>).

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agencies have evaluated this proposed rule under the Executive Order, the DOT Order, the FHWA Order, and the FTA Circular. The Agencies have determined that the proposed changes to <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p771">23 CFR parts 771</ref> and 774, if finalized as proposed, would not cause disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects on minority or low income populations.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">At the time the Agencies apply the NEPA implementing procedures in <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p771">23 CFR part 771</ref>, the Agencies would have an independent obligation to conduct an evaluation of the proposed action under the applicable EJ orders and guidance to determine whether the proposed action has the potential for EJ effects. The rule would not affect the scope or outcome of that EJ evaluation. In any instance where there are potential EJ effects resulting from a proposed Agency action covered under any of the NEPA classes of action in <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p771">23 CFR part 771</ref>, public outreach under the applicable EJ orders and guidance would provide affected populations with the opportunity to raise any concerns about those potential EJ effects. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> DOT Order 5610.2(a), FHWA Order 6640.23A, and FTA Policy Guidance for Transit Recipients (available at links above). Indeed, outreach to ensure the effective involvement of minority and low income populations where there is potential for EJ effects is a core aspect of the EJ orders and guidance. For these reasons, the Agencies have determined that no further EJ analysis is needed and no mitigation is required in connection with the proposed revisions to the Agencies' NEPA and Section 4(f) implementing regulations (<ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p771">23 CFR parts 771</ref> and 774).

The CEQ regulations do not direct agencies to prepare a NEPA analysis or document before establishing agency procedures (such as this regulation) that supplement the CEQ regulations for implementing NEPA. The changes proposed in this rule are part of those agency procedures, and therefore establishing the proposed changes does not require preparation of a NEPA analysis or document. Agency NEPA procedures are generally procedural guidance to assist agencies in the fulfillment of agency responsibilities under NEPA, but are not the agency's final determination of what level of NEPA analysis is required for a particular proposed action.

Third-party contracting is a voluntary arrangement whereby the project sponsor retains a contractor to assist in conducting the environmental review under the direction, supervision, and control of the Administration. FRA must oversee the preparation of the EIS and retains ultimate control over the third-party contractor's work product. FRA may require use of a third-party contractor for preparation of an EA at its discretion. FRA, the project sponsor, and the contractor will enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that outlines at a minimum the conditions and procedures to be followed in carrying out the MOU and the responsibilities of the parties to the MOU.

Early scoping constitutes initiation of NEPA scoping while local planning efforts to aid in establishing the purpose and need and in evaluating alternatives and impacts are underway. Notice of early scoping must be made to the public and other agencies. If early scoping is the start of the NEPA process, the early scoping notice must include language to that effect. After development of the proposed action at the conclusion of early scoping, FRA or FTA will publish the Notice of Intent if it is determined at that time that the proposed action requires an EIS. The Notice of Intent will establish a 30-day period for comments on the purpose and need, alternatives, and the scope of the NEPA analysis.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to approve the state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) on behalf of the State of Maryland in response to EPA's <date date="2017-02-03">February 3, 2017</date> Findings of Failure to Submit for various requirements relating to the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). This SIP revision is specific to nonattainment new source review (NNSR) requirements. In the Final Rules section of this <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>, EPA is approving the State's SIP submittal as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial submittal and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed description of the state submittal and EPA's evaluation is included in a technical support document (TSD) prepared in support of this rulemaking action. A copy of the TSD is available, upon request, from the EPA Regional Office listed in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-2">ADDRESSES</inline> section of this document or is also available electronically within the Docket for this rulemaking action. If no adverse comments are received in response to this action, no further activity is contemplated. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in <?page num="45548"?>a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time.

This revision concerns emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), oxides of nitrogen (NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline>) and particulate matter (PM) from the idling of diesel-powered trucks. We are proposing to approve portions of a state rule to regulate these emission sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act). We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action.

These provisions strengthen the SIP by establishing new operating standards that complement the previously approved technology requirements in Section 2485. The Idling Restrictions do not interfere with applicable requirements concerning attainment and reasonable further progress or other CAA requirements, as set forth in CAA section 110(l), and do not modify any existing SIP control requirement in a nonattainment area, in accordance with CAA section 193.

We are unaware of any idling restriction in place in another area that is fewer than 5 minutes. The TSD has more information on our evaluation.

Infrastructure SIPs address the applicable requirements of Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110, which requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of each new or revised NAAQS promulgated by the EPA. These SIPs are commonly referred to as “infrastructure” SIPs. The infrastructure requirements are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA.

We have published a direct final rule approving the State's SIP revisions in the “Rules and Regulations” section of this issue of the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>, because we view this as a noncontroversial action and anticipate no relevant adverse comment. We have explained our reasons for this action in the preamble to the direct final rule. A detailed technical support document (TSD) is included in this rulemaking docket to address the following: A description of Clean Air Act section 110(a)(1) and (2) infrastructure SIPs; the applicable elements under sections 110(a)(1) and (2); EPA's approach to the review of infrastructure SIP submissions, and EPA's evaluation of how Iowa addressed the relevant elements of sections 110(a)(1) and (2). If we receive no adverse comment, we will not take further action on this proposed rule. If we receive adverse comment, we will withdraw the direct final rule and it will not take effect. We would address all public comments in any subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. We do not intend to institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting must do so at this time.

Infrastructure SIPs address the applicable requirements of Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110, which requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of each new or revised NAAQS promulgated by the EPA. These SIPs are commonly referred to as “infrastructure” SIPs. The infrastructure requirements are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA.

We have published a direct final rule approving the State's SIP revision (s) in the “Rules and Regulations” section of this issue of the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>, because we view this as a noncontroversial action and anticipate no relevant adverse comment. We have explained our reasons for this action in the preamble to the direct final rule. A detailed Technical Support Document (TSD) is included in this rulemaking docket to address the following: A description of Clean Air Act section 110(a)(1) and (2) infrastructure SIPs; the applicable elements under sections 110(a)(1) and (2); EPA's approach to the review of infrastructure SIP submissions, and EPA's evaluation of how Iowa addressed the relevant elements of sections 110(a)(1) and (2). If we receive no adverse comment, we will not take further action on this proposed rule. If we receive adverse comment, we will withdraw the direct final rule and it will not take effect. We would address all public comments in any subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. We do not intend to institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting must do so at this time.

This withdrawal is based on our conclusion that the threats to the species as identified in the proposed rule are not as significant as we previously determined and the proposed listing is not warranted. We base this conclusion on our analysis of new information concerning the results of new surveys, current and future threats, and conservation efforts. We find the best scientific and commercial data available indicate that the Kenk's amphipod does not meet the statutory definitions of an endangered or threatened species. Therefore, we are withdrawing our proposed rule to list the Kenk's amphipod as an endangered species.

On <date date="2016-09-30">September 30, 2016</date>, we issued a proposed rule to add the Kenk's amphipod as an endangered species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in <ref href="/us/cfr/t50">title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations</ref> (<ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s17.11/h">50 CFR 17.11(h)</ref>). Our proposal was based on threats due to poor water quality, erosion, and sedimentation resulting from urban runoff at the Maryland and the District of Columbia locations and the effects of small population size and climate change at all known locations (<ref href="/us/fr/81/67270">81 FR 67270</ref>). This document withdraws our proposed rule to list the Kenk's amphipod as an endangered species under the Act because we have now determined that the threats to the species are not as significant as we previously determined and additional populations have been discovered in Virginia with threats that will be reduced or eliminated through conservation measures; therefore, listing is not warranted.

We have determined that the threats to the Kenk's amphipod are not as significant and the species is more widely distributed than we previously determined and that listing is not warranted. Therefore, this document withdraws our proposed rule to list the Kenk's amphipod as an endangered species under the Act.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Please refer to the proposed listing rule for the Kenk's amphipod (<ref href="/us/fr/81/67270">81 FR 67270</ref>; <date date="2016-09-30">September 30, 2016</date>) for a detailed summary of species' information; however, we note key pieces of updated information below.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Kenk's amphipod (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Stygobromus kenki</inline>) is a moderately small subterranean crustacean, growing to a maximum length of approximately 0.22 inches (in) (5.5 millimeters (mm)), that can co-occur with other amphipods, such as the Potomac ground water amphipod (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">S. tenuis potomacus</inline>), Hay's spring amphipod (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">S. hayi),</inline> Tidewater amphipod (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">S. indentatus</inline>), and Rappahannock spring amphipod (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">S. foliatus</inline>). Subterranean species like the Kenk's amphipod may live for 4 to 6 years, or even longer (Foltz and Jepson 2009, p. 2; Culver 2016, pers. comm.).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Accurate identification of the Kenk's amphipod can occur only when a specimen is removed from the seepage spring site (hereafter referred interchangeably as seepage spring, seep, spring, or site depending upon the reference), and preserved in alcohol or other fixing agent for identification by a species expert who removes legs and other appendages from the specimen for microscopic examination. This identification method is the best scientific method available. Because the laboratory identification results in mortality, and the species co-occurs in at least one site with the federally listed Hay's spring amphipod, the Service has been judicious in limiting the frequency and number of specimens removed from known sites.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Habitat
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Amphipods of the genus <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Stygobromus</inline> occur in ground water and ground water-related habitats (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> caves, seeps, small springs, wells, interstices, and, rarely, deep ground water lakes). The Kenk's amphipod is found in wooded areas where ground water emerges to form seepage springs (Holsinger 1978, p. 39). More specifically, Culver and Pipan (2014, pp. 22–23) refer to this habitat as the hypotelminorheic. Hypotelminorheic is described as habitats: (1) With a perched aquifer fed by subsurface water that creates a persistent wet spot; (2) underlain by a clay or other impermeable layer typically 5 to 50 centimeters (cm) (2 to 20 in) below the surface; and (3) rich in organic matter compared with other aquatic subterranean habitats. The water supplying the springs infiltrates to the ground water from precipitation and runoff into the catchment (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> recharge or drainage) areas. The water exits these habitats at seepage springs. The shading, hydrology, and organic matter found in these woodlands are considered important factors in maintaining suitable habitat (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> for feeding, breeding, and sheltering) for the species.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Springs known to currently support the Kenk's amphipod are found in forested areas with moderate to steep slopes, adjacent to streams, and overlying the Wissahickon geologic formation in the Piedmont of Maryland and the District of Columbia and in the Calvert formation just above the Nanjemoy formation in the upper Coastal Plain of Virginia. The Kenk's amphipod has been found in the dead leaves or fine sediment submerged in the waters of its seepage spring outflows (Holsinger 1978, p. 130). The species will move between the surface and subterranean portions of the spring habitat, but it is unknown when or how often that movement occurs (Kavanaugh 2009, p. 3).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Our previous understanding of seepage springs drainage areas was that these springs typically drain an area of less than 10,000 square meters (2.5 acres (ac); 1 hectare (ha)). The Service contracted with the Maryland Geological Survey to delineate the recharge areas of the six Kenk's amphipod's seepage spring sites in Maryland and the District of Columbia (Burnt Mill Spring #6, East Spring, Kennedy Street Spring, Sherrill Drive Spring, Coquelin Run Spring, and Holsinger Spring) (Staley 2016, pp. 1–46; Staley 2017, pers. comm.). In addition, the Maryland Geological Survey conducted electrical resistivity surveying to determine elevations of bedrock or clay that may be perching the water table, and to detect elevation of the water table of three of the Washington metropolitan area seepage springs (Burnt Mill Spring #6, East Spring, and Kennedy Street Spring) (Staley 2016, pp. 1–46). The surface watershed area of the springs ranged from the largest area of 22,055 square meters (m<sup style="-uslm-sgm:SU">2</sup>) (237,402 square feet (ft<sup style="-uslm-sgm:SU">2</sup>) (Holsinger Spring) to the smallest of 2,345 m<sup style="-uslm-sgm:SU">2</sup> (25,241 ft<sup style="-uslm-sgm:SU">2</sup>) (East Spring) (Staley 2016, pp. 1–46; Staley 2017, pers. comm.).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">However, these watershed boundary calculations do not accurately reflect the extent and magnitude of the subsurface ground water flow to the springs, since fracture zones in the bedrock underlying the saturated zones may extend a spring's ground water source beyond the surface watershed boundaries. The saturated zones supplying water to these springs appear to extend to a depth of 10 meters (m) (32.8 ft) or more at locations near each of these springs (Staley 2016, pp. 1–46); they are underlain by bedrock or dense saprolite (material derived from weathered bedrock). This finding suggests that at some locations the ground water source for these seepage springs may not be as shallow as described by Culver and Chestnut (2006, p. 2), and could be influenced by a larger area than the surface catchment area. This finding may also mean that the Kenk's amphipod could be present at times in deeper subsurface water or in fractured portions of bedrock.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Kenk's amphipod has been documented from a total of 13 seepage spring sites: East Spring, Holsinger Spring, Sherrill Drive Spring and Kennedy Street Spring in Rock Creek Park, managed by the National Park Service (NPS), in the District of Columbia; Coquelin Run Spring (privately owned) and Burnt Mill Spring #6 (county owned) in Montgomery County, MD; Upper Mill #2, Mill #4, Mill #5, Mill Creek #56, Mill Creek #58, and Mount Creek #2 on the U.S. Army Garrison's Fort A.P. Hill, in Caroline County, VA; and Voorhees Nature Preserve (owned by The Nature Conservancy (TNC)) in Westmoreland County, VA (see figure 1). While we focus our analysis on the Kenk's amphipod's known sites, we consider it likely that additional springs supporting the species could be found in Virginia because a survey of only a small portion of the potential suitable habitat outside of Fort A.P. Hill resulted in the <?page num="45553"?>discovery of the Voorhees Nature Preserve site. Surveyors had access to only publicly owned lands; potential suitable habitat also occurs on private land. In Virginia, 77 springs inside Fort A.P. Hill and 22 springs outside of Fort A.P. Hill in 3 counties (Caroline, King George, and Westmoreland) were surveyed. Two new sites were found on Fort A.P. Hill in 2017 (Mill Creek #56 and #58) with more intensive surveys. In Maryland, no new Kenk's amphipod sites were located during more widespread surveys of suitable habitat on publicly owned lands (129 springs in 5 counties (Anne Arundel, Prince George's, Charles, Calvert, and St. Mary's) in 2017.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Relative Abundance
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">There are no reliable total population numbers for Kenk's amphipod sites due to sampling difficulties (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> flow conditions) and the lack of information on the portion of the population that may remain in the springs' ground water supply (Feller 2005, p. 10). However, because surveying in the Washington metropolitan area has been conducted using systematic and consistent methodology over many years, often by the same individuals, the numbers of Kenk's amphipod individuals observed and the number of conducted surveys required to find the species are considered to be the best available data and provide a reliable indication of the species' relative abundance.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The species is typically found in small numbers and then only when ground water levels are high and springs are flowing freely, conditions that cause the Kenk's amphipod to be transported to the surface. These conditions typically occur during the spring season, except during especially dry years. Given the small size of the shallow ground water aquifers supporting the sites occupied by this species, and the known characteristics of subterranean invertebrates, it is probable that each of the Kenk's amphipod populations has always been small (Hutchins and Culver 2008, <?GPOnewLine?>pp. 3–6).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Although specimens were not collected and identified to the species level, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Stygobromus sp.,</inline> including some in the right size range for the Kenk's amphipod, were observed during site reconnaissance visits between 2004 and 2012 in several of the known Kenk's amphipod Washington metropolitan area spring habitats (Yeaman 2012, pers. comm.). In addition, visual inspections during this same time period indicated that most of the sites continued to appear to be suitable habitat, leading us to conclude that the Kenk's amphipod was extant at least at Burnt Mill Spring #6, Kennedy Street Spring, and East Spring (Feller 2015, pers. comm.). However, actual identifications of specimens collected during surveys conducted in 2015 and 2016 (Feller 2016b, pers. comm.) did not result in Kenk's amphipod being found (see below).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Prior to 2015, all Kenk's amphipod specimens were discovered on the first or second survey conducted at all known sites. In 2015 and 2016, the Kenk's amphipod was confirmed at only one of the Washington metropolitan area spring sites, Coquelin Run Spring, despite all of the sites being sampled multiple times during these 2 years (see table 1 below) (Feller 2016b, pers. comm.; Feller 2016c, pers. comm.). Additionally, an environmental DNA (eDNA) study was conducted in 2016 (Niemiller <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2016, pp. 1–7) for several amphipod species, including the Kenk's amphipod, to determine potential presence of the species in springs in the Rock Creek watershed.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Individual Kenk's amphipods were collected from Fort A.P. Hill for DNA sequencing since no individuals could be found in the Washington metropolitan area at the time (spring/summer 2016) comparative samples were required for the study (Niemiller <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2016, p. 2). Water tested in the Washington metropolitan area did not detect the Kenk's amphipod eDNA (Niemiller <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2016, p. 6). However, we cannot conclude that Kenk's amphipods were absent at those sites. The abundance of the Kenk's amphipod may not be high enough in the springs to amplify DNA in the water samples, or the DNA from the Fort A.P. Hill animals may be different enough from the Washington metropolitan area animals to not be detected in the Rock Creek water samples. Therefore, it is unclear without additional survey effort whether the species may be extirpated at Burnt Mill Spring #6, Kennedy Street Spring, and East Spring, although the best available data show a decrease in observed individuals at these sites (see table 1).</p>

One of the reviewers suggests that additional studies conducted on the basic biology and population size of the Kenk's amphipod would be helpful, noting that the more common and widespread Potomac ground water amphipod could be used as a surrogate species.

The second reviewer states that many animal and plant species exist in low population numbers, but possess adequate levels of genetic diversity to maintain their populations. This reviewer also states that because the species' ability to move between sites is considered low or perhaps nonexistent in the opinion of species experts, as discussed in the proposed rule, the Kenk's amphipod may represent isolated populations with little potential for either recolonization or colonization of suitable habitat.

The NPS has limited or discontinued the use of road salts at some locations, including Sherrill Drive, Ross Drive, Morrow Drive, and Ridge Road, where this practice might be a problem for the Hay's Spring or Kenk's amphipods (Bartolomeo 2017, pers. comm.).

We have also <?page num="45559"?>completed an analysis of the newly initiated conservation efforts at Fort A.P.

Hill 2017, p. 9–32). The INRMP includes the most recent Kenk's amphipod survey information and establishes conservation areas that will be managed with limited surface disturbance and avoidance buffers (Fort A.P. Hill 2017, pp. 9–32 to 9–34), as further described below. In addition, Fort A.P. Hill has agreed to include expanded buffer areas around any future new locations of the species. The INRMP will be revised as part of the next annual review process to reflect that continued implementation of buffers would be subject to mission requirements (Andersen 2017b, pers. comm.). The INRMP is comprehensively updated every 5 years, with review and minor amendments occurring annually. More significant updates will occur if and when new biological information becomes available or if Fort A.P. Hill's mission requirements change. The expanded buffer areas for the Kenk's amphipod designated in the INRMP are designed to maintain the species' redundancy, resiliency, and representation on Fort A.P. Hill, thus significantly contributing to the species' viability (see table 3 and the Cumulative Effects section below).

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Fort A.P. Hill consists of 76,000 acres (30,756 ha) of land with 65,000 acres (26,304 ha) of forest (Fort A.P. Hill 2017, p. 2–1). The mission of the base is to ensure soldiers are fully prepared to fight and win the Nation's wars (Fort A.P. Hill 2017, p. 12–2). Currently, 98 percent of the base is undeveloped operational training lands. Training occurs year round for both active and reserve troops of the different branches of the military (Fort A.P.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Management buffers are established around Kenk's amphipod seeps to ensure the integrity of surficial habitats and water quality from potential impacts associated with land disturbance activities. Buffers are site specific and are determined based on the size of the seep area, surrounding terrain, hydrology, and contiguity of surrounding habitats. The buffer areas for each seep generally exceed 200 ft (0.06 kilometers (km)) all around, ranging in size from 1 to 6 acres (0.40 to 2.43 ha) (average buffer area is approximately 2.3 acres (0.93 ha)). These buffers are also complemented by protections afforded to each site by adjacent wetlands and the undulating terrain of the surrounding landscape that provide additional habitat protections from disturbance activities. Within the buffers, land-disturbing activities (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> construction, land management (including pesticide application)) and ground-water-disturbing activities (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> drilling wells) are prohibited unless Fort A.P. Hill coordinates with the Service to determine ways to minimize impacts to the Kenk's amphipod (Fort A.P. Hill 2017, pp. 9–32 to 9–33).

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">All mounted military training maneuvers (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> those using tracked and wheeled vehicles) are restricted to established roads and designated open areas throughout the installation, and all tactical and nontactical vehicles must also use established stream crossings. Dismounted military maneuvers (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> those on foot) occur throughout the installation, including the training areas where Kenk's amphipod seeps occur. Kenk's amphipod seeps occur in the most undeveloped portion of the installation surrounded by an abundance of natural habitats characterized by rolling and often steep terrain. The seeps themselves where the Kenk's amphipod has been found represent an exceptionally small fraction (0.00005 percent) of the training lands and are typically less often used for military training than other areas due to their isolated nature. Soldiers are precluded from bivouacking (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> camping) or digging within the buffer areas. Maps denoting the location of Kenk's amphipod buffer areas are provided to Range Operations for the scheduling and coordination of training activities in these areas. No military training operations occur in Kenk's amphipod seep areas or buffers that use petroleum operations (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> transport, storage, and handling) or chemical training (Fort A.P.

Tactical and nontactical vehicle traffic on these trails is intermittent and is typically of low duration and intensity. The trails do not get chemically treated in the winter months nor are these trails designated for or used as transportation routes for industrial hazardous materials (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> tanker trucks). Routine recurring maintenance activities regularly conducted on installation trails include tree limbing, surface grading, application of surface material and surface and ditch stabilization. These types of maintenance activities occur as needed on these already established trails within the buffers to ensure safe access to military lands. Stabilization activities are the only type of maintenance activity that requires the application of erosion and sediment control procedures. Where stabilization of trails is required within Kenk's amphipod buffers, stabilization efforts shall be in compliance with Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control procedures (VDEQ 1992). Of the six known Kenk's amphipod sites, only two have trails within them, and these trails constitute only 1.8 mi (2.89 km) (0.3 percent of total trail miles), half of which is closed to through traffic. Trail maintenance activities are anticipated to occur on trails within Kenk's amphipod buffers less than once every 5 years. Large-scale trail improvements (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> culvert installation/replacement, trail widening) within Kenk's amphipod buffers would require discussion with the Service to minimize impacts to the species and its habitat (Fort A.P. Hill 2017, pp. 9–32 to–9–33).






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">At Fort A.P. Hill, forest management activities, including timber harvest and controlled burns, occur throughout much of the facility, including areas along Mill Creek and Mount Creek supporting Kenk's amphipod sites. No land-disturbance activities such as forest management or vegetation/habitat management will be conducted within established buffers without discussion with the Service. The seeps also occur in the non-live-fire portion of the base, meaning that wildfires are significantly less of a threat to the species or its habitat because no live rounds are used in those areas that can serve as ignition sources (Applegate 2016, pers. comm.). Additionally, when prescribed burns are used in areas adjacent to the seeps, Fort A.P. Hill will keep fire out of the buffers to the extent practicable. If a fire entered a buffer, Fort A.P. Hill would document any impacts to the buffers and the seeps (Andersen 2017c, pers. comm.).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Recreational activities are allowed within Kenk's amphipod buffer areas because installation regulations provide sufficient protections to ensure the conservation of the species. Hunting is the only recreational activity authorized in areas where three of the known Kenk's amphipod sites occur. However, strict hunting regulations severely limit the numbers of hunters allowed in an area at any given time and restrict the timing and duration for hunting. Consequently, Fort A.P. Hill is only available for hunting less than 16 percent of the year. The Kenk's amphipod sites are unlikely to <?page num="45560"?>experience adverse effects from hunting given: The limited availability of the Fort A.P. Hill landscape to hunting by the public in general; regulations prohibiting hunters from camping, digging, or using any motorized transportation (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> all-terrain vehicles, utility-terrain vehicles); that the Kenk's amphipod buffers and seep areas represent an exceptionally small amount (0.014 percent and 0.00005 percent) of the huntable areas of Fort A.P. Hill, respectively; and seeps and streams are typically avoided by hunters due to the difficulty in traversing them and the adjacent slopes. Fort A.P. Hill has offered public hunting opportunities for decades, and there has not been any evidence of adverse impacts observed at any stream, seep, or wetland to date, including the known Kenk's amphipod sites (Fort A.P. Hill 2017, p. 9–34).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Fort A.P. Hill has agreed to continued commitment to the conservation measures (buffers) identified in the 2017 INRMP regardless of the Kenk's amphipod Federal listing status, pending any currently unknown change in mission requirements (Andersen 2017a, pers. comm.). However, should the species not warrant listing under the Act, some monitoring efforts for the species could be reduced (Andersen 2017a, pers. comm.; Andersen 2017b pers. comm.).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Based on past and current primary uses of the base (forest management, recreational use, and military maneuvers), the acreage of the base, the limited area occupied by the species, including the buffers, and the habitat characteristics (mature forest on steep or rolling topography, and often adjacent to wetland areas), and the location of the seep sites (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> on isolated areas of the base), the Service concludes that there is a low risk of sites being adversely affected even if mission requirements changed.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The INRMP would result in the protection of 6 out of the 13 (46 percent) known Kenk's amphipod locations.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">PECE Analysis
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The purpose of PECE is to ensure consistent and adequate evaluation of recently formalized conservation efforts when making listing decisions. The policy provides guidance on how to evaluate conservation efforts that have not yet been implemented or have not yet demonstrated effectiveness. The evaluation focuses on the certainty that the conservation efforts will be implemented and the certainty that the conservation efforts will be effective. The policy presents nine criteria for evaluating the certainty of implementation and six criteria for evaluating the certainty of effectiveness for conservation efforts. The certainty of implementation and the effectiveness of a formalized conservation effort may also depend on species-specific, habitat-specific, location-specific, and effort-specific factors. These criteria are not considered comprehensive evaluation criteria; we consider all appropriate factors in evaluating formalized conservation efforts. The specific circumstances will also determine the amount of information necessary to satisfy these criteria.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">To consider that a formalized conservation effort contributes to forming a basis for not listing a species, or listing a species as threatened rather than endangered, we must find that the conservation effort is sufficiently certain to be (1) implemented, and (2) effective, so as to have contributed to the elimination or adequate reduction of one or more threats to the species identified through the section 4(a)(1) analysis. The elimination or adequate reduction of section 4(a)(1) threats may lead to a determination that the species does not meet the definition of threatened or endangered, or is threatened rather than endangered. An agreement or plan may contain numerous conservation efforts, not all of which are sufficiently certain to be implemented and effective. Those conservation efforts that are not sufficiently certain to be implemented and effective cannot contribute to a determination that listing is unnecessary, or a determination to list as threatened rather than endangered. Regardless of the adoption of a conservation agreement or plan, however, if the best available scientific and commercial data indicate that the species meets the definition of an “endangered species” or a “threatened species” on the day of the listing decision, then we must proceed with appropriate rulemaking activity under section 4 of the Act. Further, it is important to note that a conservation plan is not required to have absolute certainty of implementation and effectiveness in order to contribute to a listing determination. Rather, we need to be certain that the conservation efforts will be implemented and effective such that the threats to the species are reduced or eliminated.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Using the criteria in PECE (<ref href="/us/fr/68/15100">68 FR 15100</ref>, <date date="2003-03-28">March 28, 2003</date>), we evaluated the certainty of implementation (for those measures not already implemented) and effectiveness of conservation measures in the 2017 Fort A.P. Hill INRMP pertaining to the Kenk's amphipod. We determined that the measures will be effective at eliminating or reducing threats to the species because they protect currently occupied, and any future occupied, seeps and their catchment areas from removal of forest canopy and the effects of poor water quality, erosion, and sedimentation, by instituting on-the-ground protections to better manage and regulate disturbance in the species' occupied habitat. For example, two of the sites are in an area where timber harvest and prescribed burns were scheduled to occur within the next 5 years, but will not be subjected to those management actions, pending any currently unknown change in mission requirements, due to the expanded buffer areas implemented around the Kenk's amphipod sites (see below).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We have a high degree of certainty that the measures will be implemented because Fort A.P. Hill has a track record of being good environmental stewards for the past 76 years since the base was established, and, more specifically, a track record of implementing conservation measures for federally listed species and species of concern since 1997 through their INRMPs. For example, Fort A.P. Hill has effectively implemented conservation measures specified in their INRMP for the Rappahannock spring amphipod (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Stygobromus foliatus</inline>), a Department of Defense species at risk, including surveying its population and implementing avoidance buffers from ground-disturbing activities on the installation. In addition, during the spring of 2017, Fort A.P. Hill allowed access to its facility for amphipod surveys in potential suitable habitat.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">New conservation measures are prescribed by the 2017 INRMP for the Kenk's amphipod and are already being implemented, including expanded buffer areas. The 2017 INRMP has sufficient monitoring and reporting requirements to ensure that the conservation measures we deem necessary are implemented as planned, and are effective at removing threats to the Kenk's amphipod and its habitat. As specified above, the INRMP may be modified to reflect changes in mission requirements. Despite this provision, we believe that the site conditions at Fort A.P. Hill will continue to be adequate to conserve the Kenk's amphipod, and Fort A.P. Hill will discuss with the Service any changes in mission requirements that would affect the Kenk's amphipod and its habitat.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Collaboration between the Service, Fort A.P. Hill, and Virginia Department of Game &amp; Inland Fisheries previously occurred during development of the INRMP and continues to occur via discussions pertaining to <?page num="45561"?>implementation throughout the year that are documented through electronic mail correspondence and telephone calls (Hoskin 2017, pers. comm.). This ongoing coordination and collaboration ensures that the conservation measures identified in the INRMP for all Federal and State listed species and species of concern are implemented. Based on Fort A.P. Hill's implementation of previous conservation efforts as specified in its INRMP, we have a high level of certainty that the conservation measures in the 2017 INRMP will be implemented and effective, and thus they can be considered as part of the basis for our final listing determination for the Kenk's amphipod.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Habitat modification, in the form of degraded water quality and quantity, is one of the primary drivers of Kenk's amphipod viability. While the species' specific tolerances to parameters affecting water quality and quantity is not yet known, we do know that the Kenk's amphipod is at increased risk to parameters that negatively affect water quality and quantity because these freshwater amphipods spend their entire life cycle in water and are, therefore, continually exposed to changes in the aquatic habitat. Water quality degradation of ground water at spring sites located in the Washington metropolitan area has been previously cited as a top concern in several studies and reports (Feller 1997, pp. 12–13; Culver and Sereg 2004, p. 13; Feller 2005, p. 9; Hutchins and Culver 2008, p. 6; Kavanaugh 2009, p. 60; Culver <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2012, p. 37; Culver and Pipan 2014, p. 219).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The amount of forested buffer surrounding the seep influences the species' vulnerability and exposure to negative effects, and the smaller the buffer, the greater the risk of exposure. Buffer distance is important because the buffer helps filter sediment and other contaminants from the surface water entering the catchment areas and, therefore, the ground water that supports the Kenk's amphipod. The Washington metropolitan area amphipod sites have narrow riparian buffers (94 ft to 1,000 ft) (29 m to 305 m) separating them from the surrounding urban landscape. This urban land is characterized by impervious surface cover, which includes paved roads, sidewalks, parking lots, and buildings (Sexton <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2013, p. 42).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">An impervious cover analysis was conducted by the Service within the watersheds occupied by the Kenk's amphipod.

We also identified three categories of impervious cover: (1) 0 percent impervious cover, (2) 1 to 15 percent impervious cover, and (3) greater than (&gt;) 15 percent impervious cover. For each watershed, we then calculated the percentage of area that fell into each of these three categories. These percentages are presented in Table 2.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The four watersheds within the Kenk's amphipod's range have overall impervious cover estimates ranging from approximately 7 percent (Mill Creek in Virginia) to 83 percent (Lower Rock Creek in the District of Columbia and Montgomery County, MD). Although the data for this level of the impervious cover analysis were derived using the finest scale hydrologic units available in the National Land Cover dataset, they do not reference the exact location of the Kenk's amphipod spring sites in relation to the location of impervious cover within the watersheds because the spring sites and their catchment areas are at a smaller scale. Additionally, because the data are from 2011, there could be more impervious cover present than indicated in our analysis. However, by looking at aerial photographs from 1988 and 2014 of the areas surrounding the spring sites in the Washington metropolitan area, there has been little change in the amount of development; therefore, we determined that the estimates of impervious cover derived from the 2011 dataset are sufficiently accurate for our analysis.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">To provide a general indication of how much impervious cover may be influencing surface water quality at individual sites, we created maps with the individual sites included within the impervious cover data layers (see Supplemental Document—<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Maps of Impervious cover in relation to spring sites in the Washington metropolitan areas</inline> and <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Impervious cover in relation to spring sites in Virginia</inline>).






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Urban impervious surfaces can result in increased surface water flow after storm events due to decreased opportunity for immediate or proximal infiltration. The surface flow waters have higher temperatures, higher sediment loads, and higher levels of heavy metals (zinc, cadmium), nitrogen, phosphorus, and fecal coliform bacteria (Walsh <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2005, pp. 706–723). In addition to affecting water quality, urban impervious surfaces can affect water quantity; decreased infiltration can result in depletion of ground water reserves and ultimately cause springs to dry up over time (Frazer 2005, p. 3).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">When the average impervious cover is between 10 and 15 percent within a watershed, sharp declines in aquatic habitat quality and aquatic insect <?page num="45562"?>diversity are likely to occur, while the number of pollution-tolerant species increase (Schueler 1994, pp. 100–102; Boward <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 1999, p. 45; Center for Watershed Protection 2003, pp. 101–102 (synthesis of 30 studies)). More recently, declines of 110 of 238 macroinvertebrate taxa were found in streams receiving runoff water from areas that contained between 0.5 to 2 percent of impervious cover (King <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2011, pp. 1659–1675). These results were consistent among the three physiographic regions evaluated (Mountain, Piedmont, and Coastal Plain); the Piedmont region includes the Washington metropolitan area amphipod sites. Further, higher gradient, smaller catchments such as those supporting sites occupied by the Kenk's amphipod required less impervious cover than lower gradient, larger catchments to elicit a macroinvertebrate community response (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> the macroinvertebrate taxa from steeper sloped, smaller catchment areas showed a decline in response to relatively small amounts of impervious cover) (King <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2011, pp. 1659–1676). This finding is relevant, given that the results of our impervious cover analysis indicate that Kenk's amphipod sites are located within areas containing 7 to 83 percent impervious cover (see table 2).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The hypotelminorheic zone, the main habitat required by the Kenk's amphipod, may be more vulnerable to the effects of urban runoff than streams with respect to pollutants, erosion, and sedimentation because of the small size and shallow nature of the habitat. In addition, the aforementioned narrow buffer zones around the hypotelminorheic sites increase the habitat's and species' exposure to urban runoff.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Poor water quality parameters have been documented by the USGS through chemical analyses of ground water, surface water, and sediments in the Rock Creek watershed (Anderson <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.,</inline> 2002, pp. 1–99; Miller <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2006, pp. 1–48; Koterba <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2010, pp. 1–102; Phelan and Miller 2010, pp. 1–80). For example, five pesticides (carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dieldrin, and malathion) were detected in Rock Creek Park water samples at concentrations that exceed aquatic life water quality criteria (Anderson <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2002, p. 44). Furthermore, Rock Creek sediments contained polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, and toxic metals at concentrations that approached and exceeded guidelines for the protection of aquatic life (Miller <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2006, p. 21). In a 2008 study at five stream locations in Rock Creek Park, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, fragrances, flame retardants, detergents, and sterols were detected and attributed to low-level sources of wastewater entering the streams (Phelan and Miller 2010, pp. 37, 40–41).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the Washington metropolitan area, water quality degradation from urban runoff is the greatest concern for the Kenk's amphipod at the Sherrill Drive Spring location (Culver and Sereg 2004, p. 69). Sherrill Drive Spring is close (approximately 115 ft (35 m)) to the edge of Rock Creek Park where there is an abrupt change from forested habitat to an urban landscape along 16th Street Northwest, which parallels the park boundary. A significant amount of impervious cover routes runoff into the catchment area surrounding the Sherrill Drive Spring.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">While there have been no laboratory studies conducted to evaluate the effects and tolerance of the Kenk's amphipod or <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Stygobromus tenuis</inline> to chemical, nutrient, pesticide, or metal pollution, we know from published studies that amphipods may be one of the most vulnerable groups of organisms to chemical pollution due to their high sensitivity to toxicants and contaminant accumulation (Borgmann <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 1989, p. 756; Brumec-Turc 1989, p. 40). Sediment samples surrounding the springs were collected in September 2001 at East Spring and Sherrill Drive Spring to analyze metal and organic contaminants.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Toxic metals were found in the sediment samples. Values were similar for the two sites, although East Spring had the highest values for all toxic metals, with the exception of zinc (Culver and Sereg 2004, p. 65). However, because it was the springs' sediments instead of water samples that were analyzed, it is difficult to know whether the value of the metals measured in the sediments exceed aquatic life standards in water or any published values for freshwater amphipod species. Furthermore, water samples taken from the springs in Rock Creek Park and at Burnt Mill Spring #6 in June 2016 did not detect toxic metals (Pinkney 2017b, pers. comm.). Sources of trace metals in an urban environment may include vehicles, streets, parking lots, snowpacks, and rooftops (Center for Watershed Protection 2003, p. 73). However, although the Washington metropolitan area spring sites are exposed to these sources, there is no quantitative evidence that toxic metals are affecting the springs or the Kenk's amphipod.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Water samples collected from 2000 to 2003 found nitrate levels as high as 30.8 milligrams per liter (mg/L) at Sherrill Drive Spring (Culver and Sereg 2004, p. 109). In 2016, nitrate concentrations at Sherrill Drive Spring were 3.9 mg/L and 4.2 mg/L at Burnt Mill Spring #6 (Pinkney 2017, pers. comm.). Statistical analysis of Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) data indicated that detrimental effects were present in fish and benthic communities at critical nitrate-N threshold values of 0.83 mg/L and 0.86 mg/L, respectively (Morgan <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2007, pp. 160–161). These threshold values are significantly lower than the values reported at Sherrill Drive Spring and Burnt Mills Spring #6.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We do not know how typical the Sherrill Drive Spring or Burnt Mill Spring #6 nitrate concentrations are and if chronic exposure is occurring, but we know that <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Stygobromus</inline> specimens have not been detected at Sherrill Drive Spring since 2001 or at Burnt Mill Spring #6 since 2005 (see table 1). We also do not know the potential source of the nitrate since it could come from runoff containing fertilizers or animal waste or from sanitary sewer leaks. However, a sanitary sewer line runs adjacent to the Sherrill Drive Spring, and this sewer line has leaked in the past (Feller 1997, p. 37; Yeaman, 2014, pers. comm.).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Other high levels of nutrients were also evident in the June 2016 sampling conducted by the Service's Chesapeake Bay Field Office (Pinkney 2017b, pers. comm.). The EPA (2000) ecoregional proposed criterion for stream total nitrogen of 0.69 mg/L was exceeded at the following seepage spring locations: Kennedy Street Spring (1.9 mg/L), Sherrill Drive Spring (6.5 mg/L), East Spring (9.7 mg/L), Holsinger Spring (20.9 mg/L), and Burnt Mill Spring #6 (24.2 mg/L). The EPA stream total phosphorus criterion of 0.036 mg/L was exceeded at all five seepage springs with a maximum concentration of 1.3 mg/L at Kennedy Street Spring. The MBSS thresholds were 1.3 mg/L total nitrogen and 0.043 mg/L total phosphorus for benthic communities (no thresholds were determined for fish communities) (Morgan <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2007, pp. 160–161).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Chloride levels as high as 227 mg/L were detected at Sherrill Drive Spring. The EPA chronic ambient water quality criterion for chloride is 230 mg/L (EPA 2016, entire). Although we do not know the exact source of the elevated chloride levels at Sherrill Drive Spring, one potential source could be road salt. The Washington metropolitan area receives, on average based on 69 years of data taken at Washington National Airport, approximately 19.5 inches of snow annually <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">(</inline>Southeast Regional Climate Center 2017, entire; Current Results 2017, entire). The District of Columbia Department of Public Works uses road <?page num="45563"?>salt and other salt products to pre- and post-treat road surfaces before and after ice and snowfall events (District of Columbia Department of Public Works 2017, entire). However, the NPS has discontinued the use of road salts at some locations within Rock Creek Park (Bartolomeo 2017, pers. comm.). The widespread use of salt to deice roadways has led to regionally elevated chloride concentrations equivalent to 25 percent of the chloride concentration in seawater during winter. The concentrations can remain high throughout the summer even in less urbanized watersheds due to long-term (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> decades) accumulation of chloride in ground water (Kaushal <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2005, pp. 13518–13519). This phenomenon was documented by the Service's June 2016 detection of a chloride concentration of 227 mg/L at Sherrill Drive Spring (Pinkney 2017a, pers. comm.). Analyses of MBSS data on fish and benthic communities yielded critical chloride values of 17 mg/L for fish and 50 mg/L, respectively, as thresholds above which there would be detrimental effects on biotic communities (Morgan <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2007; pp. 160–161). Thus, the concentrations measured in June 2016 (Pinkney 2017a, pers. comm.) at Kennedy Street Spring (56.3 mg/L), Holsinger Spring (70.7 mg/L), Burnt Mill Spring #6 (115 mg/L), and Sherrill Drive Spring (237 mg/L) all exceed thresholds for benthic communities. Furthermore, chloride concentrations in ground water may move slower (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> dilute slower) than in surface waters and thus the effects from winter road salt application may be more persistent in the surrounding environment (Findlay and Kelly 2011, p. 66).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">At Coquelin Run Spring, ground water pollution from yard chemicals and road runoff (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> road salts, oil) could be a concern for the Kenk's amphipod's long-term viability. The USGS research on water quality degradation in other urban areas indicates that chemicals enter waterways and ground water primarily through runoff from rain events, and these chemicals have commonly been detected in streams and shallow ground water (USGS 1998, entire; USGS 1999a, pp. 1–3; USGS 1999b, p. 1; USGS 2001, p. 2). Although no water samples have been taken at the Coquelin Run Spring site, it is separated from backyards in this neighborhood by a narrow, wooded riparian strip (less than 100 ft) (30 m) that slopes steeply down to the site. Therefore, the Coquelin Run Spring may be at increased risk of exposure to chemical pollutants from the surrounding urban development.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The other four Washington metropolitan area sites (Burnt Mill Spring #6, Holsinger Spring, East Spring, and Kennedy Spring) have wider buffers than Sherrill Drive Spring and Coquelin Run Spring, with buffer distances ranging from approximately 272 ft (83 m) to 1,000 ft (305 m). East Spring and Kennedy Spring had much lower conductivity and nitrate levels than Sherrill Drive Spring in the 2000, 2001, and 2003 sampling (Culver and Sereg 2004, pp. 55–58), but were still above criteria suggested by Morgan <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> (2007, p. 161). Surveys conducted in 2015 and 2016 did not re-confirm the Kenk's amphipod at any of these sites but consistently found <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Stygobromus tenuis</inline> at all the sites in higher numbers (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> greater than 40 observed at Burnt Mill Spring #6 during 1 sampling event). Urban runoff can decrease biotic richness and favor more pollution-tolerant species in urban streams (Center for Watershed Protection 2003, pp. 101–102). If <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">S. tenuis</inline> has a higher tolerance than the Kenk's amphipod to poor water quality parameters, the change in species' composition discussed in the proposed rule's (<ref href="/us/fr/81/67270">81 FR 67270</ref>; <date date="2016-09-30">September 30, 2016</date>) <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Relative Abundance</inline> section and Factor E<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">—Changes in Species Composition</inline> could indicate that urban runoff is negatively affecting the Kenk's amphipod populations at these spring sites.

While the NPS uses its regulatory authority to manage water quality concerns for the species within Rock Creek Park, the agency has little influence over the protection of or effects to any seep recharge areas occurring outside park boundaries, and over maintenance or repair of city-owned infrastructure such as storm water and sewer systems located near the spring sites. See the proposed rule (<ref href="/us/fr/81/67270">81 FR 67270</ref>; <date date="2016-09-30">September 30, 2016</date>) for a list of laws and policies influencing NPS management.

Water quality in this area is expected to worsen due to significant runoff events from anticipated increases in both winter and spring precipitation and the frequency of high-intensity storms.

However, we find that poor water quality is not impacting the Virginia spring sites because the sites are located in forested areas with low levels of impervious cover, and we do not anticipate those conditions to change into the future. In addition, the measures in Fort A.P Hill's INRMP and the location of one site on conservation land provides protections to the species.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the Washington metropolitan area, excessive storm water flows are causing significant habitat degradation at two sites—Sherrill Drive Spring and Coquelin Run Spring. A washout at Sherrill Drive Spring from 16th Street was observed in 2016 making it difficult to find a seep to survey (Feller 2016f, pers. comm.). Coquelin Run Spring is severely degraded by runoff from the surrounding Chevy Chase Lake Subdivision, where severe erosion was first observed at this site in 2006 (Feller 2016h, pers. comm.). Subsequent surveys of the site found evidence of plastic underground pipe and sheeting, which may have been an attempt to address water flow and erosion at the site, in close proximity to the original seep and further erosion of the site (Feller 2016a, pers. comm.; Feller 2016e, pers. comm.). A small flow was observed in May 2016 but was located several feet above the original seep documented in 2006. It is unknown what affect the pipe or plastic may have on the long-term hydrology of the site.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Erosion from storm water flows has also been observed at the other three springs in Rock Creek Park, but not to the extent that it has been observed at Sherrill Drive and Coquelin Run Springs. It is unknown how much chronic or acute erosion and sedimentation causes a site to become unsuitable for the Kenk's amphipod; however, Culver and Sereg (2004, p. 69) found that sediment transported by storm runoff results in the degradation of ground water animals' habitat by clogging the interstices of gravels in the <?page num="45564"?>spring seep, thereby preventing the species from using those interstitial spaces for shelter. It is uncertain to what extent the Kenk's amphipod uses those interstitial spaces, but if they do, then it is plausible that this type of sedimentation would cause the habitat to become unsuitable for the species.

However, erosion and sediment control repairs to the culvert and the surface of the associated unimproved trail conducted prior to the proposed rule has dramatically improved current conditions. Consequently, sheetflow is not considered a threat to the conservation of the Kenk's amphipod at this location (Applegate 2017, pers. comm.).

Coquelin Run Spring, Burnt Mill Spring #6, and Sherrill Drive Spring are most vulnerable to sewage spills because they are located downhill from several sewer lines (see table 2 in the proposed rule (<ref href="/us/fr/81/67270">81 FR 67270</ref>; <date date="2016-09-30">September 30, 2016</date>) for details). The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) has documented numerous large (more than 1,000 gallons) and small (more than 100 gallons) leaks in both the Rock Creek and Northwest Brach drainages (WSSC 2015). The District of Columbia does not have such detailed records, but half the District of Columbia's 1,800 mi (2,896 km) of sewer lines are at least 84 years old and faulty pipes result in two dozen sewer spills every year (Olivio 2015). The frequency of spills is likely to increase in the future as the sewer lines continue to age.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Kenk's amphipod is likely susceptible to changes to the forest canopy and understory; this theory is supported by the fact that they can be found in leaf litter. The more common species <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Stygobromus tenuis</inline> has been found to actively exit the hypotelminorheic under appropriate conditions, presumably to forage (Kavanaugh 2009, p. 3), and they are found only in forested areas (Culver 2016, pers. comm.).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the Washington metropolitan area, there have been no land-disturbance activities such as forest management or vegetation/habitat management activities conducted at Rock Creek Park or at the Montgomery County park in the vicinity of the seeps. At Rock Creek Park, the NPS has taken steps to prevent designated trails from being built in areas that could affect the Kenk's amphipod, and there are no trails in close vicinity to the seep found at the county park. At the privately owned site, an underground pipe previously installed on the hillside where the seep is located was observed in 2016, and, despite the steep topography, there is the potential for foot traffic in the seepage area by the landowners. The Service is unaware of any tree removal ever occurring at this site.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In general, stressors to the Kenk's amphipod habitat at the Virginia sites are less significant than those in the Washington metropolitan area because land use is primarily agriculture and forest with little impervious surface. See the description of Fort A.P. Hill under the Ongoing and Future Conservation Measures section above. With the possible exception of the effects of climate change and the potential effects of small population dynamics (see Factor E below), we are unaware of any stressors at Voorhees Nature Preserve (Hobson 2017a, pers. comm.). The preserve is located 8.5 mi (13.7 km) east across the Rappahannock River from Fort A.P. Hill in Westmoreland County, Virginia. The 729-acre (295-hectare) parcel has been owned by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) since 1994. The goal of the preserve is to protect the mature coastal plain forest and freshwater tidal marsh (Truslow 2017a, pers. comm.).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As of July 2017, human activity at the preserve is limited to maintenance of approximately 3 mi (4.8 km) of hiking trails, white-tailed deer management through a hunt lease with a local hunt club, and annual monitoring to ensure the protection goals of the property are being met. There is light recreational use from the 3 mi (4.8 km) of hiking trails located on the property. The trails are open only for foot travel (approximately several hundred visitors a year based on trail logs); no ATVs or bikes are allowed on the trails (Truslow 2017b, pers. comm.). Dogs are also not allowed at the preserve (TNC 2017, entire).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The seep where the Kenk's amphipod was found is not impacted by the trail because it is located approximately 30 to 40 ft (9.1 to 12.2 m) down slope of the trail, at the head of a ravine, and it is surrounded by dense vegetation, which makes access to the site difficult (Hobson 2017a, pers. comm.). There is also no visible erosion from the trail (C. Hobson 2017a, pers. comm.).

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The TNC developed a site-management plan upon assuming ownership. Timber harvesting will not occur where there is mature forest, and uplands will be kept in a forested condition to protect the property's marsh from sedimentation runoff. In addition, TNC will not use pesticides (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> dimilin) to control future gypsy moth infestations (TNC 1994).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In terms of the property's protection status, TNC preserves are considered to be permanently protected. The deed does not contain restrictions on TNC selling or transferring the property; however, TNC policy would require that the property be transferred to an entity that would manage for similar conservation goals (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> a State natural resource agency or Federal agency), or that it be restricted by a conservation easement that would ensure permanent protection of the property (Truslow 2017a, pers. comm.).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The preserve is surrounded primarily by forest, and there is Service-owned National Wildlife Refuge land and State-owned land west of the site. A soil enhancement facility was proposed in 2014 at a parcel approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) northeast of the seep. The purpose of the facility would be to compost biosolids from sewage and sell the compost as fertilizer. If the site was approved and constructed, it would not impact the Kenk's amphipod because the seep is at a higher elevation and in a different surface catchment area than the proposed soil enhancement facility.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">
                                          <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Summary of Factor A</inline>—Habitat modification, in the form of degraded water quality and quantity, is one of the primary drivers affecting Kenk's amphipod viability at the Washington metropolitan area sites, despite ongoing conservation measures. Reductions in water quality continue to occur at those sites primarily as a result of urbanization, which increases the amount of impervious cover in the watersheds surrounding six of the Kenk's amphipod sites. Impervious cover increases storm water flow velocities, decreases ground water filtration, and increases erosion and sedimentation. Impervious cover can also increase the transport of contaminants and nutrients common in urban environments, such as metals (zinc, cadmium), nitrogen, phosphorus, and fecal coliform bacteria. The Washington metropolitan area sites have narrow riparian buffers separating them from the surrounding development, increasing the sites' exposure to poor water quality from runoff. While poor water quality has been documented at Sherrill Drive Spring and is likely affecting all six sites in the Washington metropolitan area, the seven Virginia sites are not thought to be affected by poor water quality because of the large forested buffers on Fort A.P. Hill and Voorhees Nature Preserve.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Excessive storm water runoff from heavy rain events can result in flooding, which can cause erosion and sedimentation. Habitat degradation due to excessive storm water flows is having effects at two sites—Sherrill Drive Spring and Coquelin Run Spring—but has also been observed at the other four springs in Rock Creek Park, and may increase in the future. At the Virginia sites, we have no information indicating excessive storm water flows affect the species.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Sewer and water line breaks and leaks are a concern at the Washington metropolitan area sites because most of them are located in the same riparian areas that contain the habitats of the Kenk's amphipod. While leaks and breaks of these pipelines have not yet been known to directly affect the species or its habitat, the pipeline systems are subjected to chronic leaks and breaks, the frequency of which is likely to increase given the age of the infrastructure, and thus the exposure risk of the species to this stressor will continue to increase. Coquelin Run Spring, Burnt Mill Spring #6, and Sherrill Drive Spring are most vulnerable to sewage spills and water pipe breaks due to the pipe's proximity to each site and the age of the pipes. At the Virginia sites, we have no information indicating sewer or water pipeline breaks will affect the species.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Stressors to Kenk's amphipod habitat are significantly less in scope and severity at Fort A.P. Hill and Voorhees Nature Preserve than at the Washington metropolitan area habitats, due to the location of the sites, the current and foreseeable mission of the managing entities, and the conservation measures described in the INRMP and TNC Management Plan. The risk is low that any disturbance to the surface habitat on those properties would result in adverse effects to the species. We acknowledge that the Washington metropolitan sites face a number of stressors that will continue into the future. Of the six Washington sites, only one site has a recent record of Kenk's amphipod. We cannot confirm without additional consecutive negative survey results, but it is possible that this species is functionally extinct in the Washington metropolitan area given the stressors it faces and the lack of specimens found in recent survey results. Conversely, the seven Virginia sites do not face the same stressors as the Washington metropolitan area sites. Habitat quality at the Virginia sites is good and the sites all have some form of protection, either from the measures in the Fort A.P. Hill INRMP or the TNC nature preserve's site-management plan.

However, there is significant uncertainty regarding the extent to which the number of Kenk's amphipods observed at the seep surface accurately reflects the actual population at each site given the species' known ability to move between the surface and subsurface habitat. We are unaware of any reliable method to accurately estimate the actual population size of the Kenk's amphipod at each of its historical and current sites. In addition, the multiple sites (six in the Washington metropolitan area and seven in Virginia) provide some protection against stochastic and catastrophic events affecting all sites simultaneously (see the Cumulative Effects section below).

However, neither study resulted in any information that helped us better understand the Kenk's amphipod's genetics, distribution, or potential for dispersal (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> metapopulation structure). Therefore, unless the populations are larger than we know or are hydrologically connected such that individuals can move between sites, we maintain that these small populations are vulnerable to the effects of small population dynamics.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Species that are restricted in range and population size are more likely to suffer loss of genetic diversity due to genetic drift, potentially increasing their susceptibility to inbreeding depression, and reducing the fitness of individuals (Soule 1980, pp. 157–158; Hunter 2002, pp. 162–163; Allendorf and Luikart 2007, pp. 117–146). Small population sizes and inhibited gene flow between populations may increase the likelihood of local extirpation (Gilpin and Soulé 1986, pp. 32–34). With the exceptions for the Fort A.P. Hill populations of Mill Creek #2 and Mill Creek #4, which are separated by only approximately 360 ft (110 m), and Mill Creek #56 and #59, which are approximately 2,640 ft (805 m) from the other two Mill Creek sites and 1,056 ft (322 m) apart from each other, all the other populations of the Kenk's amphipod are isolated from other existing populations and known habitats by long distances, inhospitable upland habitat, and terrain that create barriers to amphipod movement. The level of isolation and the restricted range seen in this species, based on our <?page num="45567"?>current knowledge of known habitat, make natural repopulation of known habitats (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> the District of Columbia sites and Burnt Mill Spring #6 where the species' presence has not been recently confirmed) virtually impossible without human intervention.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Climate change may result in changes in the amount and timing of precipitation, the frequency and intensity of storms, and air temperatures. All of these changes could affect the Kenk's amphipod and its habitat. The amount and timing of precipitation influence spring flow, which is an important feature of the habitat of this ground water species. Also, the frequency and intensity of storms affects the frequency, duration, and intensity of runoff events, and runoff transport of sediment and contaminants into catchment areas of Kenk's amphipod sites, especially in the Washington metropolitan area, where there is a substantial amount of impervious cover in close proximity to the habitat (see Factor A summarized above and in detail in the proposed rule (<ref href="/us/fr/81/67270">81 FR 67270</ref>; <date date="2016-09-30">September 30, 2016</date>)). Below we discuss the best available climate predictions for the areas supporting the Kenk's amphipod.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The 2014 National Climate Assessment (Melillo <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2014, entire) predicts increasing ambient temperatures, increasing winter and spring precipitation, increasing frequency of heavy downpours, and increasing summer and fall drought risk as higher temperatures lead to greater evaporation and earlier winter and spring snowmelt (Horton <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2014, p. 374 <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">In</inline> Melillo <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2014). Without more specific information about how seeps are connected underground, as well as the ability of the amphipods to migrate within the soil column in response to drying from drought conditions, it is unclear to what degree the temporary drying of these habitats will affect the Kenk's amphipod (Carter 2016, pers. comm.). Alternatively, an increase in heavy downpours will likely result in increased runoff and resulting erosion of surface features at spring sites, based on previously documented events. The 2014 National Climate Assessment further indicates that overall warming in the Northeast, including Maryland and the District of Columbia, will be from 3 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) (1.7 to 5.6 degrees Celsius (°C)) by the 2080s (Horton <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2014, p. 374 <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">In</inline> Melillo <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2014). The Southeast region, which includes Virginia, is projected to see a regional average temperature increase of 4 to 8 °F (2.2 to 4.4 °C) (Carter <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2014, p. 399 <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">In</inline> Melillo <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2014).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Data specific to the District of Columbia from NOAA's National Climate Data Center (NOAA 2017, entire) shows that the average annual air temperature in the District of Columbia has already increased by approximately 2 °F (1.1°C) from 1960, the decade corresponding to the first Kenk's amphipod surveys, to 2016. This higher rate of change in the District of Columbia may be due to the urban heat island effect (Oke 1995, p. 187), which is an increase in ambient temperature due to heating of impervious surfaces. This activity also results in an increase in temperature of rainwater that falls on heat-absorbing roads and parking lots. A sudden thunderstorm striking a parking lot that has been sitting in hot sunshine can easily result in a 10 °F (5.6 °C) increase in the rainfall temperature. Menke <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> (2010, pp. 147–148) showed that these temporary increases in temperature of storm water can still result in a shift in the biotic community composition and even accelerate changes in species distributions. Based on the work of Menberg <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> (2014, entire), we expect these changes in air temperature to be reflected in the temperature of the shallow ground water at all sites within a few years, but at a lower magnitude.





</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Increased temperature is stressful to aquatic life through several mechanisms. First, at higher temperatures, the metabolic rate of invertebrates and fish is higher and more rapid ventilation is needed by the animal to obtain oxygen, which is less soluble (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> less available) in warmer versus cooler water (Schiedek <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2007, p. 1846). Second, the rates that cold-blooded animals metabolize certain chemicals into more toxic forms increase at higher temperatures. This characteristic can either cause sublethal effects that inhibit the animal's ability to feed, breed, or escape from predators, or can be lethal due to increased toxicity at higher temperatures. For example, organophosphate insecticides are metabolically transformed into the more toxic oxon form. This oxon form is lethal to animals because it inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (Hooper <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2013, p. 36). Illustrating this toxicity, laboratory experiments exposed the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Gammarus pseudolimnaeus</inline> amphipod to the organophosphates terbufos and trichlorofon (Howe <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 1994, p. 58). In one set of experiments, terbufos was demonstrated to be seven times more toxic at 62 °F (17 °C) than at 45 °F (7 °C). And third, ammonia, derived from wastewater, fertilizers, and runoff from animal wastes, is more toxic to all aquatic life at higher temperatures because a greater fraction exists in the more toxic un-ionized form (EPA 2013, p. 7). Thus, the EPA aquatic life criteria are temperature (and pH) dependent with lower limits at higher temperatures for a given pH. It is important to note we do not have specific temperature tolerance information for the Kenk's amphipod; however, there are studies of other amphipod species that indicate these animals have a sensitivity to elevated temperatures, as exhibited by reduced or eliminated egg survival at water temperatures above 75 °F (24 °C) to 79 °F (26 °C) (Pockl and Humpesch 1990, pp. 445–449).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In summary, if current climate change predictions become reality, by the 2080s some increase in ground water temperatures will occur at sites occupied by the Kenk's amphipod, yet the magnitude and significance of these changes is difficult to predict.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">At most of the Washington metropolitan area sites supporting the Kenk's amphipod, numbers of the Potomac ground water amphipod, which is the most widely distributed and abundant <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Stygobromus</inline> species in the lower Potomac drainage (Kavanaugh 2009, p. 6), have increased as numbers of observed Kenk's amphipods have declined (Feller 2016b, pers. comm.; Feller 2016c, pers. comm.). The exact cause of this change is not known, but it may be an indication that some stressor has led to a competitive advantage for the Potomac ground water amphipod (Culver <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2012, p. 29). Other than at Coquelin Run Spring, there are no obvious physical changes at these sites indicating a cause for the decline. However, as described in Factor A, impaired water quality could favor a more common species over a rare species. Culver and Sereg (2004, pp. 72–73) indicated that there is a possibility that the Kenk's amphipod is a poor competitor with other <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Stygobromus</inline> species, which may be a factor promoting the Kenk's amphipod's natural rarity, and that in cave locations <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Stygobromus</inline> species strongly compete with each other. Only one site in the Washington metropolitan area was surveyed in 2017, Burnt Mills Spring #6. That site continues to have a large number of <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">S. tenuis</inline> and no Kenk's amphipod (Feller 2016g, pers. comm.). The more common species <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">S. tenuis</inline> and <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">S. foliatus</inline> are found at the Virginia sites, but they are less abundant than what has been observed in the Washington metropolitan area sites (Hobson 2017b, pers. comm.). While the Kenk's amphipod may have always been <?page num="45568"?>naturally rare, we conclude that the species may be getting rarer at the Washington metropolitan area sites due to the stressors discussed above.

The believed small size and isolation of sites also make each population vulnerable to demographic stochasticity, including loss of genetic variability and adaptive capacity.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The best available climate data indicate that the areas supporting the Kenk's amphipod will see increasing ambient temperatures, increasing winter and spring precipitation, increasing frequency of heavy downpours, and increasing summer and fall drought risk as higher temperatures lead to greater evaporation and earlier winter and spring snowmelt. Droughts could result in drying up of spring sites, while the increase in heavy downpours could result in erosion and sedimentation of sites. Ambient air temperature has increased by 3 °F (1.7 °C) since 1960, and is expected to increase by 8 to 10 °F (4.4 to 5.6 °C) by the 2080s. If current climate change predictions become a reality, by the 2080s some increase in ground water temperatures will occur at sites occupied by the Kenk's amphipod, but the magnitude and significance of these changes is difficult to predict.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Many of the factors previously discussed are cumulatively and synergistically affecting the Kenk's amphipod primarily in the Washington metropolitan area. For example, Kenk's amphipod habitat can be degraded by storm water runoff when there is not adequate forest buffer, which is likely to increase with more frequent and intense storms and precipitation levels in the future. Species with larger populations are naturally more resilient to the stressors affecting individuals or local occurrences, while smaller populations or individuals are more susceptible to demographic or stochastic events. Below we discuss the Kenk's amphipod's viability as expressed through the conservation biology principles of representation, redundancy, and resiliency, which illustrate how the cumulative and synergistic effects are affecting the species as a whole.

Currently, the species is known to be extant at one of the Washington metropolitan area sites and seven of the Virginia sites. We assume that the Sherrill Drive Spring site is extirpated. Although we cannot confirm without additional consecutive negative survey results, given the lack of recent positive surveys and the existing stressors at the five other Washington metropolitan area sites, it is possible that these sites are functionally extinct, which means that the population at each site is so reduced that the site population is no longer viable.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The isolation of the two Montgomery County, MD, populations from other Washington metropolitan area populations and their occurrence along different tributary streams make it unlikely that a single catastrophic adverse event (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> a spill) will eliminate more than one occurrence at a time. In addition, the Virginia sites on Fort A.P. Hill occur in two stream areas, Mill Creek and Mount Creek, making it unlikely that a single military training event or other catastrophic event will eliminate more than one occurrence at a time. In addition, subsequent to the species' proposal for endangered status, it was found in the spring of 2017 approximately 8.5 mi (13.7 km) away and across the Rappahannock River from the known Fort A.P. Hill sites. This finding, together with the discovery of two new sites on Fort A.P. Hill, contributes to additional redundancy for the species.

Also, because we do not yet have sufficient information on the genetics of these populations, we cannot determine whether the species possesses a single genetic identity or has genetic variability across populations. However, the species is now known to occur within habitat supported by two different geological formations, the Wissahickon and Nanjemoy. While we conclude that the species' representation has likely been reduced from historical levels, it may not be as limited as we thought at the time of the proposed rule given our expanded understanding of suitable habitat and the three new locations found during the spring 2017 surveys on public land.

The small size of each of the 13 habitat areas makes each population vulnerable to natural environmental stochasticity and human-caused habitat disturbance, including relatively minor effects in the spring recharge area. As a result of habitat fragmentation/isolation there is a lack of connectivity and genetic exchange between populations and, we assume, a lack of ability to recolonize extirpated sites. However, the larger number of Kenk's amphipods found at two of the newly discovered sites, together with the expectation that seven of the sites will be adequately protected from habitat quality stressors, leads us to believe that the resiliency of the Kenk's amphipod at a majority of its sites is higher than we thought at the time of the proposed listing rule.

The issue has not been addressed by a Federal Court of Appeals.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For the purposes of this rule, we interpret the SPR phrase in the Act's definitions of “endangered species” and “threatened species” to provide an independent basis for listing a species in its entirety; thus there are two situations (or factual bases) under which a species would qualify for listing: A species may be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future throughout all of its range; or a species may be in danger of extinction or likely to become so throughout a significant portion of its range. If a species is in danger of extinction throughout an SPR, it, the species, is an “endangered species.” The same analysis applies to “threatened species.” Therefore, the consequence of finding that a species is in danger of extinction or likely to become so throughout a significant portion of its range is that the entire species will be listed as an endangered species or threatened species, respectively, and the Act's protections will be applied to all individuals of the species wherever found.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Although there are potentially many ways to determine whether a portion of a species' range is “significant,” we conclude, for the purposes of this rule, that the significance of the portion of the range should be determined based on its biological contribution to the conservation of the species. For this reason, we describe the threshold for “significant” in terms of an increase in the risk of extinction for the species. We conclude that such a biologically based definition of “significant” best conforms to the purposes of the Act, is consistent with judicial interpretations, and best ensures species' conservation.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For the purposes of this rule, we determine if a portion's biological contribution is so important that the portion qualifies as “significant” by asking whether, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">without that portion,</inline> the species in the remainder of its range warrants listing (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> is in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future). Conversely, we would not consider the portion of the range at issue to be “significant” if the species would not warrant listing in the remainder of its range even if the population in that portion of the range in question became extirpated (extinct locally).








</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We interpret the term “range” to be the general geographical area within which the species is currently found, including those areas used throughout all or part of the species' life cycle, even if not used on a regular basis. We consider the “current” range of the species to be the range occupied by the species at the time the Service makes a determination under section 4 of the Act. The phrase “is in danger” in the definition of “endangered species” denotes a present-tense condition of being at risk of a current or future undesired event. Hence, to say a species “is in danger” in an area where it no longer exists—<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> in its historical range where it has been extirpated—is inconsistent with common usage. Thus, “range” must mean “current range,” not “historical range.” A corollary of this logic is that lost historical range cannot constitute a significant portion of a species' range where a species is in danger of extinction or likely to become so within the foreseeable future (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> it cannot be currently in danger of extinction in a portion of its range where it is already extirpated). While we conclude that a species cannot be in danger of extinction in its lost historical range, taking into account the effects of loss of historical range on a species is an important component of determining a species' current and future status.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In implementing these independent bases for listing a species, as discussed above, we list any species in its entirety either because it is in danger of extinction now or likely to become so in the foreseeable future throughout all of its range or because it is in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future throughout a significant portion of its range. With regard to the text of the Act, we note that Congress placed the “all” language before the SPR phrase in the definitions of “endangered species” and “threatened species.” This placement suggests that Congress intended that an analysis based on consideration of the entire range should receive primary focus. Thus, the first step in our assessment of the status of a species is to determine its status throughout all of its range. Depending on the status throughout all of its range, we will subsequently examine whether it is necessary to determine its status throughout a significant portion of its range.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under section 4(a)(1) of the Act, we determine whether a species is an endangered species or threatened species because of any of the following: (A) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (B) Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; (C) Disease or predation; (D) The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or (E) Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. These five factors apply whether we are analyzing the species' status throughout all of its range or throughout a significant portion of its range.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Our review of the best available information indicates that the Kenk's amphipod is known to be extant at one of the Washington metropolitan area sites and seven of the Virginia sites. We assume that the Sherrill Drive Spring site is extirpated. Although we cannot confirm without additional consecutive negative survey results, given the lack of recent positive surveys and the existing stressors at the other Washington metropolitan area sites, it is possible that these sites are functionally extinct. Three of the Virginia sites were recently discovered during the 2017 surveys of suitable habitat on publicly owned lands. While there appears to be evidence of extirpation at one site (Sherrill Drive Spring) and decline of the species at four Washington metropolitan area sites (East Spring, <?page num="45570"?>Kennedy Spring, Holsinger Spring, and Burnt Mill Spring #6), and one individual was collected at Coquelin Run Spring, the number of Kenk's amphipods found during the 2017 surveys was slightly higher at two of the previously known Fort A.P. Hill sites (Mount Creek #2 and Upper Mill Creek #2), the same at one previously known Fort A.P. Hill site (Mill Creek #4), and higher at two new sites on Fort A.P. Hill (Mill Creek #56 and Mill Creek #59); one of the previously known Fort A.P. Hill sites was not surveyed (Mill Creek #5) due to lack of spring flow. In addition, the species was newly discovered at the Voorhees Nature Preserve. It is possible that the species could be found at additional locations in Virginia based on the amount of yet-to-be-surveyed suitable habitat.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The habitat loss and degradation (Factor A) from poor water quality parameters associated with urban runoff affecting the Kenk's amphipod at the six Washington metropolitan area sites, despite existing regulatory mechanisms (Factor D), are likely to be exacerbated in the future by the increasing risk of exposure to breaks and leaks from the aging sewer and water pipe infrastructure (Factor A), as well as the predicted more frequent and intense rainfall events, resulting in sheet flow events, due to the effects of climate change (Factor E). However, poor water quality associated with urban runoff is not affecting the species at the seven sites in Virginia. Interspecific competition (Factor E) from larger amphipod species may also be affecting the Kenk's amphipod at some of the Washington metropolitan area sites, but the available information is inconclusive, and those larger amphipod species, while found at some of the Virginia sites, have not been found in large numbers (Hobson 2017b, pers. comm.). Overutilization (Factor B), disease (Factor C), and predation (Factor C) are not known to be factors affecting the Kenk's amphipod at any site. It is possible that the effects of small population dynamics (Factor E) may be having an effect at some, if not all, of the species' locations, but there is some uncertainty associated with that hypothesis given the species' known ability to move back and forth between the ground water and surface areas of the seeps and given the survey data indicating the species can reappear, sometimes in higher numbers of individuals, after several years of absence. It is also possible that increasing air temperatures as a result of climate change (Factor E) will cause ground water temperatures to eventually increase, that the ground water will become too warm by the end of the century for the Kenk's amphipod to successfully reproduce, and that higher ground water temperatures will increase the species' exposure, and sublethal and lethal response, to contaminants. However, there is some uncertainty associated with that hypothesis given the long timeframes (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> more than 50 years) associated with the climate modelling and the unknown water temperature tolerance of the Kenk's amphipod.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Although there are some stressors that are expected to continue to result in the degradation and loss of some habitat sites for the Kenk's amphipod, the risk of the species significantly declining across its range in the near term is very low given that it has persisted, albeit at decreased levels, despite historical levels of habitat loss in the Washington metropolitan area. Factors in favor include the species' presence in relatively higher numbers at the Virginia sites. Furthermore, the existing stressors are not likely to cause species-level effects in the near term. The documented persistence of the species at one location in the Washington metropolitan area and seven locations in Virginia provides redundancy, resiliency, and representation to sustain the species beyond the near term. Therefore, we conclude that the risk of extinction of the Kenk's amphipod in the near term is sufficiently low that it does not meet the definition of an endangered species under the Act.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Act defines a threatened species as “any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.” A key statutory difference between an endangered species and a threatened species is the timing of when the relevant threats would begin acting upon a species such that it is in danger of extinction <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">now</inline> (endangered species) or likely to become so in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">foreseeable future</inline> (threatened species).

We must look not only at the foreseeability of threats, but also at the foreseeability of the impact of the threats on the species (U.S. Department of the Interior's Solicitor's Memorandum, M–37021, <date date="2009-01-16">January 16, 2009</date>).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In considering the foreseeable future as it relates to the status of the Kenk's amphipod, we considered the extent to which we could reliably predict the species' risk of extinction over time. Our ability to make reliable predictions into the future for the Kenk's amphipod is informed by the species' survey data; the potential effects to the species from ongoing and predicted stressors, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the species' response to those stressors; and ongoing and future conservation measures to address the known stressors. The future timeframe for this analysis is 30 years, which is a reasonably long time to consider as the foreseeable future given the Kenk's amphipod's life history and the temporal scale associated with the patterns of survey data and the past and current stressors outlined in the best available data. The timeframe for foreseeable future is based, in part, on projecting forward. A similar timeframe encompassed by the historical survey results shows decades in which the species was present, absent, and then present again at some seep sites. This timeframe also captures our best professional judgment of the projected potential range of future conditions related to the effects of climate change (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> the period in which the species' response to the potential effects of climate change are reliably predictable) and cumulative effects.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Since the analysis of potential effects from climate change was an important consideration in our analysis, it was necessary to consider a long enough timeframe to adequately evaluate those potential effects. However, we did not extend our risk assessment forecasting used in the listing determination process out as far as the existing climate change models (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> models that forecast effects over 80 years) discussed in the proposed listing rule (<ref href="/us/fr/81/67270">81 FR 67270</ref>) due to (1) the increased uncertainty in the model results (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> the confidence intervals associated with temperature and precipitation projections); (2) the higher level of uncertainty of how the species may respond to any potential changes in its habitat that may result from changes in temperature and precipitation patterns; and (3) uncertainty associated with how society will respond to the predicted change in climate (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> take actions that will mediate or accelerate global emissions) that far into the future. As an example of biological uncertainty, there are significant questions regarding the extent to which the number of Kenk's amphipods observed at the seep surface accurately reflects the actual population at each site given the species' known <?page num="45571"?>ability to move between the surface and subsurface habitat.








</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">These uncertainties are additive and undermine the Service's confidence in making a risk assessment projection beyond 30 years. Therefore, as further described below, a projection of the threats and the effects to the species of 30 years represents the timeframe over which the Service considers a reliable prediction to be possible.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As we concluded above, the stressors likely to have the greatest influence on the Kenk's amphipod's viability over time include: Changes in habitat quality and quantity resulting from urbanization in the Washington metropolitan areas and the potential for the effects of small population dynamics and increased ground water temperatures due to climate change at all sites. Given the risk factors affecting the species currently and/or potentially in the future, we determined the following:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• The best available information indicates that the risk is low that changes in habitat quality resulting from changes in temperature will result in aggregate or species-level effects in the foreseeable future.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• There is significant uncertainty regarding the timeframe in which the predicted climate-induced changes to air temperature will manifest in ground water (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> whether those changes will occur within the foreseeable future).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent to which the number of Kenk's amphipods observed at the seep surface accurately reflects the actual population at each site given the species' known ability to move between the surface and subsurface habitat. The best available data indicate that the risk of the dynamics of small population size affecting the species is low because even if the species may exist in low numbers at most or all of the 13 known sites, it is very unlikely that all of the sites would be exposed to catastrophic or stochastic events at the same time. Therefore, the species is not likely to be extirpated at most or all of the sites within the foreseeable future.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Taking into account the effects of the most likely stressors and the potential for cumulative effects to the species, our projections for foreseeable future conditions are that the risk is low that the Kenk's amphipod will not continue to be distributed across multiple seep sites within the species' current range. These multiple areas will help the Kenk's amphipod withstand catastrophic events; meaning the risk is low that a significant weather or other event will cause extirpation of the species at most or all sites. Also, we project that the risk is low that the species will not continue to be present in multiple areas, especially in Virginia, in adequate abundance to withstand stochastic events. For example, the risk is low that a training or hunting event at Fort A.P. Hill causing damage to a seep site will cause extirpation of the species at that site.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Based on our analysis of the species' redundancy, resiliency, and representation, and our consideration of the species' future stressors and conservation measures to address those stressors, we conclude that the Kenk's amphipod is likely to remain at a sufficiently low risk of extinction such that it is not likely to become in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future and thus does not meet the definition of a threatened species under the Act.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Consistent with our interpretation that there are two independent bases for listing species as described above, after examining the species' status throughout all of its range, we now examine whether it is necessary to determine its status throughout a significant portion of its range. We must give operational effect to both the “throughout all” of its range language and the SPR phrase in the definitions of “endangered species” and “threatened species.” The Act, however, does not specify the relationship between the two bases for listing. As discussed above, to give operational effect to the “throughout all” language that is referenced first in the definition, consideration of the species' status throughout the entire range should receive primary focus and we should undertake that analysis first. In order to give operational effect to the SPR language, the Service should undertake an SPR analysis if the species is neither in danger of extinction nor likely to become so in the foreseeable future throughout all of its range, to determine if the species should nonetheless be listed because of its status in an SPR. Thus, we conclude that to give operational effect to both the “throughout all” language and the SPR phrase, the Service should conduct an SPR analysis if (and only if) a species does not warrant listing according to the “throughout all” language.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Because we determined that the Kenk's amphipod is not in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future throughout all of its range, we will consider whether there are any significant portions of its range in which the Kenk's amphipod is in danger of extinction or likely to become so.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Although there are potentially many ways to determine whether a portion of a species' range is “significant,” we conclude, as noted above, for the purposes of this rule, that the significance of the portion of the range should be determined based on its biological contribution to the conservation of the species. For this reason, we describe the threshold for “significant” in terms of an increase in the risk of extinction for the species. We conclude that such a biologically based definition of “significant” best conforms to the purposes of the Act, is consistent with judicial interpretations, and best ensures species' conservation.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We evaluate biological significance based on the principles of conservation biology using the concepts of redundancy, resiliency, and representation because decreases in the redundancy, resiliency, and representation of a species lead to increases in the risk of extinction for the species. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Redundancy</inline> (having multiple resilient populations considering genetic and environmental diversity) may be needed to provide a margin of safety for the species to withstand catastrophic events. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Resiliency</inline> describes the characteristics of a species that allow it to recover from stochastic events or periodic disturbance. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Representation</inline> (the range of variation found in a species) ensures that the species' ability to adapt to changing environments is conserved. Redundancy, resiliency, and representation are not independent of each other, and some characteristics of a species or area may contribute to all three. For example, distribution across a wide variety of habitats is an indicator of representation, but it may also indicate a broad geographic distribution contributing to redundancy (decreasing the chance that any one event affects the entire species), and the likelihood that some habitat types are less susceptible to certain threats, contributing to resiliency (the ability of the species to recover from disturbance). None of these concepts is intended to be mutually exclusive, and a portion of a species' range may be determined to be “significant” due to its contributions under any one of these concepts.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For the purposes of this rule, we determine if a portion's biological contribution is so important that the portion qualifies as “significant” by asking whether, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">without that portion,</inline> the representation, redundancy, or resiliency of the species would be so impaired that the species would be in danger of extinction or likely to become <?page num="45572"?>so in the foreseeable future (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> would be an “endangered species” or a “threatened species”). Conversely, we would not consider the portion of the range at issue to be “significant” if there is sufficient resiliency, redundancy, and representation elsewhere in the species' range that the species would not be in danger of extinction or likely to become so throughout its range even if the population in that portion of the range in question became extirpated (extinct locally).










 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We recognize that this definition of “significant” establishes a threshold that is relatively high. Given that the outcome of finding a species to be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in an SPR would be to list the species and apply protections of the Act to all individuals of the species wherever found, it is important to use a threshold for “significant” that is robust. It would not be meaningful or appropriate to establish a very low threshold whereby a portion of the range can be considered “significant” even if only a negligible increase in extinction risk would result from its loss. Because nearly any portion of a species' range can be said to contribute some increment to a species' viability, use of such a low threshold would require us to impose restrictions and expend conservation resources disproportionately to conservation benefit: Listing would be rangewide, even if only a portion of the range with minor conservation importance to the species is imperiled. On the other hand, it would be inappropriate to establish a threshold for “significant” that is too high. This would be the case if the standard were, for example, that a portion of the range can be considered “significant” only if threats in that portion result in the entire species' being currently in danger of extinction or likely to become so. Such a high bar would not give the SPR phrase independent meaning, as the Ninth Circuit held in <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Defenders of Wildlife</inline> v. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Norton,</inline> 258 F.3d 1136 (9th Cir. 2001).

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The definition of “significant” used in this rule carefully balances these concerns. By setting a relatively high threshold, we minimize the degree to which restrictions would be imposed or resources expended that do not contribute substantially to species conservation. But we have not set the threshold so high that the phrase “throughout a significant portion of its range” loses independent meaning. Specifically, we have not set the threshold as high as it was under the interpretation presented by the Service in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Defenders</inline> litigation. Under that interpretation, the portion of the range would have to be so important that the species' current level of imperilment in the portion results in the species currently being in danger of extinction or likely to become so throughout all of its range.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under the definition of “significant” used in this rule, the portion of the range need not rise to such an exceptionally high level of biological significance. (We recognize that, if the portion rises to the higher level of biological significance and the species is in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future in that portion, then the species would already be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future throughout all of its range. We would accordingly list the species as threatened or endangered throughout all of its range by virtue of the species' rangewide status so we would not need to rely on the SPR language for such a listing.) Rather, under this interpretation we ask whether the species would be in danger of extinction or likely to become so everywhere without that portion, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> if the species were hypothetically completely extirpated from that portion. In other words, the portion of the range need not be so important that its current status in that portion of its range—being merely in danger of extinction, or likely to become so in the foreseeable future—is sufficient to cause the species to be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future throughout all of its range. Instead, we evaluate whether the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">complete extirpation</inline> (in a hypothetical future) of the species in that portion would at that point cause the species throughout its remaining range to be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We are aware that the court in <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Center for Biological Diversity</inline> v. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Jewell</inline> found that this definition of “significant” does not give sufficient independent meaning to the SPR phrase. However, that decision was based on two misunderstandings about the interpretation of “significant.” First, the court's decision was based on its finding that, as with the interpretation that the court rejected in <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Defenders</inline>, the definition of “significant” does not allow for an independent basis for listing. However, this definition of “significant” is not the same as the definition applied in <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Defenders,</inline> which looked at the current status within the portion and asked what the current effect on the entire range of the species is. By contrast, this definition of “significant” looks at a future hypothetical loss of all members within the portion and asks what the effect on the remainder of the species would be; the current status of the species in that portion is relevant <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">only</inline> for determining the listing status if the portion has been determined to be significant. This definition of “significant” establishes a lower threshold than requiring that the species' current status in that portion of its range is already causing the species to be in danger of extinction throughout all of its range or likely to become so in the foreseeable future. In other words, this definition of “significant” captures circumstances that would not be captured by the definition used in <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Defenders,</inline> or by analyzing whether a species is in danger of extinction or likely to become so throughout all of its range: A species that is <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">not</inline> currently likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future, but would be if a particular important portion of its range is completely lost, can nonetheless be listed now if the species in that portion is threatened or endangered (as opposed to only after the portion is in fact lost, as would be the case if the SPR language did not exist).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The second misunderstanding was the court's characterization of the listing determination for the African coelacanth as an indication that the Service and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have had difficulty accurately applying this definition of “significant.” However, in that listing determination, the conclusion was that the species was not in danger of extinction throughout all of its range or likely to become so in the foreseeable future but it did warrant listing because of its status in a significant portion of its range. The only reason for not listing the entire species was that the population in that portion of the range met the definition of a DPS, and therefore the agency listed the DPS instead of the entire species. The population in an SPR is not automatically a DPS so, contrary to the court's reasoning, the definition of “significant” can be applied and result in listing a species that would not otherwise be listed. (We also note another instance, in addition to the one cited in this case, in which this definition has been effectively applied. In the proposed rule to list the giant manta ray as a threatened species (<ref href="/us/fr/82/3694">82 FR 3694</ref>; <date date="2017-01-12">January 12, 2017</date>), NMFS found that the giant manta ray was not currently in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future throughout all of its range because the Atlantic populations were not experiencing the same risks as the Pacific populations. However, they did find that the Pacific populations constituted an SPR, because, without that portion, the smaller and more <?page num="45573"?>sparsely distributed populations in the Atlantic would become vulnerable to demographic risks and would be likely to become in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the giant manta ray is proposed to be listed as a threatened species.) In light of these flaws, we are currently seeking reconsideration of the district court's decision.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">To undertake this analysis, we first identify any portions of the species' range that warrant further consideration. The range of a species can theoretically be divided into portions in an infinite number of ways. To identify only those portions that warrant further consideration, we determine whether there is substantial information indicating that there are any portions of the species' range: (1) That may be “significant,” and (2) where the species may be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future. We emphasize that answering these questions in the affirmative is not a determination that the species is in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future throughout a significant portion of its range—rather, it is a step in determining whether a more-detailed analysis of the issue is required.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In practice, one key part of identifying portions for further analysis may be whether the threats or effects of threats are geographically concentrated in some way. If a species is not in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future throughout all of its range and the threats to the species are essentially uniform throughout its range, then the species is not likely to be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future in any portion of its range. Moreover, if any concentration of threats applies only to portions of the species' range that are not “significant,” such portions will not warrant further consideration.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">If we identify any portions (1) that may be significant and (2) where the species may be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future, we engage in a more-detailed analysis to determine whether these standards are indeed met. The identification of an SPR does not create a presumption, prejudgment, or other determination as to whether the species is in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future in that identified SPR. We must go through a separate analysis to determine whether the species is in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the SPR. To make that determination, we will use the same standards and methodology that we use to determine if a species is in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future throughout all of its range.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Once we have identified portions of the species' range for further analysis, we conduct a detailed analysis of the significance of the portion and the status of the species in that portion. Depending on the biology of the species, its range, and the threats it faces, it might be more efficient for us to address the significance question first or the status question first. If we address significance first and determine that a portion of the range is not “significant,” we do not need to determine whether the species is in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future there; if we address the status of the species in portions of its range first and determine that the species is not in danger of extinction or likely to become so in a portion of its range, we do not need to determine if that portion is “significant.”

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Applying the process described above, to identify whether any portions warrant further consideration, we determine whether there is substantial information indicating that (1) particular portions may be significant and (2) the species may be in danger of extinction in those portions or likely to become so within the foreseeable future.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">To identify portions where the species may be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future, we consider whether there is substantial information to indicate that any threats or effects of threats are geographically concentrated in any portion of the species' range.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We evaluated the current range of the Kenk's amphipod to determine if there are any apparent geographic concentrations of potential threats to the species. The risk factors that occur throughout the Kenk's amphipod's range include the potential for the effects of small population dynamics and the potential for increased ground water temperature resulting from the effects of climate change. Habitat loss and degradation from poor water quality parameters associated with urban runoff, however, is occurring both currently and in the foreseeable future solely at the six Washington metropolitan area sites. Thus, this one area of the species' range is subject to a type of habitat loss and degradation that is <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">not</inline> affecting the species uniformly throughout its range. We identify the Washington metropolitan area sites as a portion where the species may be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future. We next consider whether this portion may be significant. We can accomplish this by considering the biological or conservation importance of the portion.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">While the six Washington metropolitan area sites represent 46 percent of the Kenk's amphipod's known populations and represent a diversity of sites because they occur on one of the two known geological formations, the risk is low that, should the species become extirpated in all of those locations, that loss would be sufficient to cause the remainder of the species to be in danger of extinction or likely to become so within the foreseeable future, given the Kenk's amphipod would still be present in 54 percent of its range (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> the seven Virginia sites). The Virginia sites are protected against the effects of poor water quality parameters.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We have identified the Washington metropolitan area sites as a portion where the species may be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future. However, there is not substantial information to indicate that this portion is significant. Therefore, this portion does not warrant further consideration to determine whether the species may be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future in a significant portion of its range.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">To identify portions that may be significant, we consider whether there is substantial information to indicate that there are any natural divisions within the range or other areas that might be of biological or conservation importance. We identified the Virginia sites (spring seeps on Fort A.P. Hill and the Voorhees Nature Preserve) as a portion that may be significant. These sites are separated from the Washington metropolitan area sites by 60 mi (97 km). The spring sites in these areas occur in the Calvert geologic formation, whereas the Washington metropolitan area sites occur in the Wissahickon geologic formation. Given the separation between the Washington metropolitan sites and the Virginia sites and the inability of the Kenk's amphipod to travel long distances, we conclude that there is no genetic exchange between these two areas. Therefore, we find that there is substantial information that there are natural divisions between the Virginia and Washington metropolitan sites and that the Virginia site may be significant. We did not find substantial evidence that the Washington metropolitan sites are a significant portion because, without that portion, there is no reasonable likelihood that the remainder of the species (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> those at the Virginia <?page num="45574"?>sites) would be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future, due to the paucity of threats affecting the Virginia sites.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We have identified the Virginia sites as a portion that may be significant. We next consider whether the species may be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future in this portion. We can accomplish this task by considering whether there is substantial information indicating that there are any threats to or effects of threats on the species that are concentrated in that portion. The Virginia sites are not affected by the same threats we identified for the Washington metropolitan area sites (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> water quality impacts and habitat degradation), because the Virginia sites occur in areas where land use is primarily agriculture and forest with little impervious surface and spring sites are surrounded by large forest buffers that would filter out any potential effects of runoff from the agricultural areas. We do not find there is substantial information indicating there is a concentration of threats in the Virginia portion.

Manufacturers and other persons storing dairy products must also report to USDA information on the quantity of dairy products stored. This information is used by USDA to help administer Federal programs and is used by the dairy industry in planning, pricing, and projecting supplies of milk and milk products.

USDA publishes composites of the information obtained to help industry members make informed marketing decisions regarding dairy products. The information is also used to establish minimum prices for Class III and Class IV milk under Federal milk marketing orders. Additional paper forms are filed by manufacturers on an annual basis to validate participation in the mandatory reporting program. USDA uses the information collected to verify compliance with applicable regulations.

Annual validation information is reported on Forms DA–230 and DA–230–S. Manufacturers and others who are required to file reports under this program must also maintain original records associated with the sale and storage of dairy products for two years and must make those records available to USDA upon request. Manufacturers who produce and market less than one million pounds of cheddar cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk, or dry whey are exempt from the reporting requirements for those products.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) administers the Trademark Act, <ref href="/us/usc/t15/s1051">15 U.S.C. 1051</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.,</inline> which provides for the Federal registration of trademarks, service marks, collective trademarks and service marks, collective membership marks, and certification marks. Individuals and businesses who use their marks, or intend to use their marks, in commerce regulated by Congress may file an application with the USPTO to register their marks. Registered marks remain on the register indefinitely, so long as the owner of the registration files the necessary maintenance documents. The rules implementing the Trademark Act are set forth in <ref href="/us/cfr/t37/p2">37 CFR part 2</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Act and rules mandate that each certificate of registration include the mark, the particular goods and/or services for which the mark is registered, the owner's name, dates of use of the mark in commerce, and certain other information. The USPTO also provides similar information to the public concerning pending applications. Individuals or businesses may determine the availability of a mark by accessing the register through the USPTO's Web site: <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">www.uspto.gov/trademark.</inline> Accessing and reviewing the USPTO's publicly available information may reduce the possibility of initiating use of a mark previously registered or adopted by another. Thus, the Federal trademark registration process reduces unnecessary litigation and its associated costs and burdens.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Trademarks can be registered on either the Principal or Supplemental Register. Registrations on the Principal Register confer all of the benefits of registration provided under the Trademark Act. Certain marks that are not eligible for registration on the Principal Register, but are capable of functioning as a trademark, may be registered on the Supplemental Register. Registrations on the Supplemental Register cannot be transferred to the Principal Register, but owners of registrations on the Supplemental Register may apply for registration of their marks on the Principal Register.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The information in this collection can be submitted in paper format or electronically through the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS). Applicants who file using the TEAS RF or TEAS Plus forms pay a lower filing fee than applicants who file using the TEAS Regular form. These applicants must agree to file certain communications regarding the application through TEAS and to receive communications by email. TEAS Plus users must also file a “complete” application, select their identification(s) of goods/services from the USPTO's Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual, and pay the fees for all classes at the time of filing. TEAS Plus applications are only available for trademark/service mark applications. There are no TEAS Plus application forms available for certification marks, collective marks, collective membership marks, and applications for registration on the Supplemental Register at this time.

However, this collection does have annual (non-hour) cost burden in the form of filing fees, processing fees, and postage costs. The USPTO amended its rules to set, increase or decrease certain trademark fees, effective <date date="2017-01-14">January 14, 2017</date> affecting many of the fees in this collection.

Applicants who file their applications electronically instead of submitting them on paper pay a reduced filing fee. Those who choose to file TEAS RF or TEAS Plus applications pay a further reduced fee. An application must include a filing fee for each class of goods and services. Therefore, the total filing fees associated with this collection can vary depending on the number of classes in each application.

The public uses the information in this collection to petition for various actions under <ref href="/us/cfr/t37/s1.17/f">37 CFR 1.17(f)</ref>, (g), and (h), such as petitioning for a suspension of the rules, requesting access to an assignment record, or requesting the withdrawal of an application from issue either before or after paying the issue fee. In addition, the public uses these petitions to request accelerated examination, to request abandonment of an application to avoid publication of said application, and to request certain extensions of time. The public uses the transmittal form to remit the required fees for the various petitions. The USPTO uses the information collected from the petitions and transmittal form to determine whether to grant the various requests and to ensure that the proper fees have been remitted and are processed accordingly.

These Annual State Public Water System Compliance Reports are to include violations of maximum contaminant levels, treatment requirements, variances and exemptions, and monitoring requirements determined to be significant by the Administrator after consultation with the states. To minimize a state's burden in preparing its annual statutorily-required report, EPA issued guidance that explains what Section 1414(c)(3)(A) requires and provides model language and reporting templates. EPA also annually makes available to the states a computer query that generates for each state (from information states are already separately required to submit to EPA's national database on a quarterly basis) the required violations information in a table consistent with the reporting template in EPA's guidance.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (<ref href="/us/usc/t44/s3501–3520">44 U.S.C. 3501–3520</ref>), federal agencies must obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for each collection of information they conduct or sponsor. The term “collection of information” is defined in <ref href="/us/usc/t44/s3502/3">44 U.S.C. 3502(3)</ref> and <ref href="/us/cfr/t5/s1320.3/c">5 CFR 1320.3(c)</ref> and includes agency requests or requirements that members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (<ref href="/us/usc/t44/s3506/c/2/A">44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)</ref>) requires federal agencies to publish a 30-day notice in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> concerning each proposed collection of information, including each proposed extension or reinstatement of an existing collection of information, before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To comply with this requirement, CMS is publishing this notice that summarizes the following proposed collection(s) of information for public comment:

As stated in 42 CFR Sec. 414.40(a) CMS establishes uniform national definitions of services, codes to represent services, and payment modifiers to the codes. The HCPCS codeset has been <?page num="45590"?>maintained and distributed via modifications of codes, modifiers and descriptions, as a direct result of data received from applicants. Thus, information collected in the application is significant to codeset maintenance.








 


</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The HCPCS codeset maintenance is an ongoing process, as changes are implemented and updated annually; therefore, the process requires continual collection of information from applicants on an annual basis. As new technology evolves and new devices, drugs and supplies are introduced to the market, applicants submit applications to CMS requesting modifications to the HCPCS Level II codeset. Applications have been received prior to HIPAA implementation and must continue to be collected to ensure quality decision-making. The HIPAA of 1996 required CMS to adopt standards for coding systems that are used for reporting health care transactions.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 1869(b)(1)(E) of the Social Security Act (the Act), as amended by section 521 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), established the amount in controversy (AIC) threshold amounts for Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearings and judicial review at $100 and $1,000, respectively, for Medicare Part A and Part B appeals. Section 940 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), amended section 1869(b)(1)(E) of the Act to require the AIC threshold amounts for ALJ hearings and judicial review to be adjusted annually. The AIC threshold amounts are to be adjusted, as of January 2005, by the percentage increase in the medical care component of the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) for July 2003 to July of the year preceding the year involved and rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. Section 940(b)(2) of the MMA provided conforming amendments to apply the AIC adjustment requirement to Medicare Part C/Medicare Advantage (MA) appeals and certain health maintenance organization and competitive health plan appeals. Health care prepayment plans are also subject to MA appeals rules, including the AIC adjustment requirement. Section 101 of the MMA provides for the application of the AIC adjustment requirement to Medicare Part D appeals.

The regulations require the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to publish changes to the AIC threshold amounts in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> (§ 405.1006(b)(2)). In order to be entitled to a hearing before an ALJ, a party to a proceeding must meet the AIC requirements at § 405.1006(b). Similarly, a party must meet the AIC requirements at § 405.1006(c) at the time judicial review is requested for the court to have jurisdiction over the appeal (§ 405.1136(a)).

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 940(b)(2) of the MMA applies the AIC adjustment requirement to Medicare Part C appeals by amending section 1852(g)(5) of the Act. The implementing regulations for Medicare Part C appeals are found at <ref href="/us/cfr/t42/p422">42 CFR 422</ref>, subpart M. Specifically, §§ 422.600 and 422.612 discuss the AIC threshold amounts for ALJ hearings and judicial review. Section 422.600 grants any party to the reconsideration, except the MA organization, who is dissatisfied with the reconsideration determination, a right to an ALJ hearing as long as the amount remaining in controversy after reconsideration meets the threshold requirement established annually by the Secretary. Section 422.612 states, in part, that any party, including the MA organization, may request judicial review if the AIC meets the threshold requirement established annually by the Secretary.

The applicable implementing regulations for Medicare Part C appeals are set forth in <ref href="/us/cfr/t42/p422">42 CFR 422</ref>, subpart M and apply to these appeals pursuant to <ref href="/us/cfr/t42/s417.600/b">42 CFR 417.600(b)</ref>.

Section 101 of the MMA added section 1860D–4(h)(1) of the Act regarding Part D appeals. This statutory provision requires a prescription drug plan sponsor to meet the requirements set forth in sections 1852(g)(4) and (g)(5) of the Act, in a similar manner as MA organizations. As noted previously, the annually adjusted AIC threshold requirement was added to section 1852(g)(5) of the Act by section 940(b)(2)(A) of the MMA. The implementing regulations for Medicare Part D appeals can be found at <ref href="/us/cfr/t42/p423">42 CFR 423</ref>, subparts M and U. The regulations at § 423.562(c) prescribe that, unless the Part D appeals rules provide otherwise, the Part C appeals rules (including the annually adjusted AIC threshold amount) apply to Part D appeals to the extent they are appropriate. More specifically, §§ 423.1970 and 423.1976 of the Part D appeals rules discuss the AIC threshold amounts for ALJ hearings and judicial review.</p>

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The AIC threshold amount for ALJ hearings will remain at $160 and the AIC threshold amount for judicial review will rise to $1,600 for CY 2018. These amounts are based on the 59.989 percent increase in the medical care component of the CPI, which was at 297.600 in July 2003 and rose to 476.130 in July 2017. The AIC threshold amount for ALJ hearings changes to $159.99 based on the 59.989 percent increase over the initial threshold amount of $100 established in 2003. In accordance with section 1869(b)(1)(E)(iii) of the Act, the adjusted threshold amounts are rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. Therefore, the CY 2018 AIC threshold amount for ALJ hearings is $160.00. The AIC threshold amount for judicial review changes to $1,599.89 based on the 59.989 percent increase over the initial threshold amount of $1,000. This amount was rounded to the nearest multiple of $10, resulting in the CY 2018 AIC threshold amount of $1,600.00 for judicial review.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled “Oncology Pharmaceuticals: Reproductive Toxicity Testing and Labeling Recommendations.” The purpose of this guidance is to assist sponsors in reproductive toxicity assessments (mainly of embryo-fetal development) for oncology pharmaceuticals and to provide recommendations for product labeling on duration of contraception following cessation of therapy to minimize potential risk to a developing embryo/fetus. The guidance also clarifies FDA's current thinking on when nonclinical studies for reproductive toxicology assessment may not be needed (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> for pharmaceuticals intended for use in postmenopausal women only). The intended outcome of this guidance is to provide for more consistent labeling for oncology pharmaceuticals and to reduce the conduct of nonclinical studies that are not informative on product use.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FDA is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled “Oncology Pharmaceuticals: Reproductive Toxicity Testing and Labeling Recommendations.” This guidance presents FDA's current approach to assessing potential risks to embryo-fetal development associated with oncology pharmaceutical use in male and female patients. The term <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">pharmaceutical</inline> in this guidance refers to small molecules, therapeutic proteins, antibodies, and related products such as conjugated products. The guidance describes when embryo-fetal developmental studies for oncology pharmaceuticals may be warranted for different types of pharmaceuticals, such as cytotoxic, biological, and conjugated pharmaceuticals, or pharmaceuticals used in combinations. The guidance also discusses other aspects of a nonclinical reproductive toxicity evaluation, such as fertility and pre- and postnatal evaluation. The guidance addresses the need for a reproductive toxicity evaluation when pharmaceuticals are used in specific populations (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> pediatric, males-only, or postmenopausal women).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Although current regulatory guidances exist regarding the need to assess the embryo-fetal developmental toxicity potential of pharmaceuticals and the overall design of the studies, this guidance provides additional recommendations on specific types of products and for specific populations, which are not covered under other guidances. In addition, this guidance provides recommendations on the use of contraception and the duration of its use to minimize the potential risks associated with the use of oncology pharmaceuticals.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This draft guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good guidance practices regulation (<ref href="/us/cfr/t21/s10.115">21 CFR 10.115</ref>). The draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of FDA on reproductive toxicity testing and labeling recommendations for oncology pharmaceuticals. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. This is not a significant regulatory action subject to <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This guidance refers to previously approved collections of information that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (<ref href="/us/usc/t44/s3501–3520">44 U.S.C. 3501–3520</ref>).

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Issues in pharmaceutical manufacturing have the potential to significantly impact patient care as failures in quality may result in product recalls and harm to patients. Additionally, product failures or facility, equipment, or manufacturing problems are a major factor leading to disruptions in drug supply. Modernizing manufacturing technology may lead to a more robust manufacturing process with fewer interruptions in production, fewer product failures (before or after distribution), and greater assurance that the drug products manufactured in any given period of time will provide the expected clinical performance. Encouraging development of emerging technology may lead to pharmaceutical innovation and modernization, such as a more robust drug product design and improved manufacturing with better process control, thereby leading to improved product quality and availability throughout a product's lifecycle.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In this program, pharmaceutical companies can, prior to the regulatory submission, submit questions and proposals about the use of specific emerging technology to a group within <?page num="45596"?>the FDA Emerging Technology Team (ETT), which includes relevant representation from all FDA pharmaceutical quality functions. The ETT works in partnership with relevant pharmaceutical quality offices and assumes a leadership or co-leadership role for the cross-functional quality assessment team (including review and on-site facility evaluation or inspection) for submissions involving emerging technology.

It provides further clarification on the criteria that the proposed technology needs to meet for its acceptance into the Emerging Technology Program. It also clarifies types of novel technology (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> product technology, manufacturing process, and control strategy) that can be covered by the program.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good guidance practices regulation (<ref href="/us/cfr/t21/s10.115">21 CFR 10.115</ref>). The guidance represents the current thinking of FDA on advancement of emerging technology applications for pharmaceutical innovation and modernization. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is establishing a public docket to solicit suggestions, recommendations, and comments from interested parties, including patients and patient representatives, health care professionals, academic institutions, regulated industry, and other interested organizations, on questions relevant to FDA's newly established Opioid Policy Steering Committee (OPSC). Opioid addiction and the resulting overdoses and deaths have created a national crisis, which requires action by federal agencies that may in some instances be unprecedented in order to address the situation and attempt to turn the tide on the crisis. As a public health agency <?page num="45598"?>responding to the crisis, FDA seek public input as it considers how its authorities can or should be used to address this crisis. This information will help the Agency understand areas of focus important to the public and identify and address opioid product and policy issues that need clarification. FDA is especially interested in hearing from interested parties in three key areas: What more can FDA do to ensure that the full range of available information, including about possible public health effects, is considered when making opioid-related regulatory decisions; what steps can FDA take with respect to dispensing and packaging (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> unit of use) to facilitate consistency of and promote appropriate prescribing practice; and should FDA require some form of mandatory education for health care professionals who prescribe opioid drug products, and if so, how should such a system be implemented?

The five point strategy includes: (1) Improving access to prevention, treatment, and recovery services; (2) targeting availability and distribution of overdose-reversing drugs; (3) strengthening timely public health data and reporting; (4) supporting cutting-edge research; and (5) advancing the practice of pain management. Following that announcement, on <date date="2017-05-23">May 23, 2017</date>, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs announced his intention to take more forceful steps to combat the opioid crisis. An OPSC was established to explore and develop additional tools or strategies FDA can use to confront this crisis. The OPSC has a broad mandate to consider steps that FDA can take to confront the opioid crisis. FDA is seeking suggestions, recommendations, and comments from interested parties, including patients and patient representatives, health care professionals, academic institutions, regulated industry, and other interested organizations, with regard to a number of topics related to three overarching questions: (1) What more can or should FDA do to ensure that the full range of available information, including about possible public health effects, is considered when making opioid-related regulatory decisions; (2) what steps can or should FDA take with respect to dispensing and packaging (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> unit of use) to facilitate consistency of and promote appropriate prescribing practice; and (3) should FDA require some form of mandatory education for health care professionals who prescribe opioid drug products, and if so, how should such a system be implemented?

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In a <date date="2017-07-06">July 6, 2017</date>, article in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Journal of the American Medical Association,</inline> FDA explained its approach to assessing the benefits and risks of drug products, describing a structured approach that, in the case of opioids, includes extensive additional review of the risks related to the potential misuse and abuse of these products. FDA explained that it is working to incorporate the effects of decisions on public health into its benefit-risk framework in a more quantitative manner that can supplement and enhance the strong qualitative work that the Agency already performs (Ref. 1). In addition, in March 2016, FDA commissioned a study from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to outline the state of the science regarding prescription opioid abuse and misuse, the evolving role that opioid analgesics play in pain management, and additional actions FDA should consider to address the opioid crisis with particular emphasis on strengthening its benefit-risk framework for opioids. That report was issued in July (Ref. 2). While FDA considers the report recommendations, we would like to solicit additional feedback that will supplement those recommendations.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Specific questions on which FDA seeks comment relating to this topic are as follows:

Are there specific public health considerations other than misuse and abuse that FDA should incorporate into its current framework for benefit and risk assessment as a way to reduce the opioid addiction epidemic? That framework includes, but is not limited to, how FDA makes regulatory decisions to approve new opioids, evaluates their use in the postmarket setting, or limits or influences their prescribing through product labeling or other risk management measures.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proper prescribing and dispensing are critical to successfully reducing opioid misuse and abuse. A 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain</inline> reported that, “[w]hen opioids are used for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dose of immediate-release opioids and should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. Three days or less will often be sufficient; more than seven days will rarely be needed.” (Ref. 3.) And a recent analysis showed that, across six studies of patients who had undergone a variety of surgical procedures, 67 percent to 92 percent of patients reported unused opioid analgesics. Moreover, “[r]ates of safe storage and/or disposal of unused opioids were low,” resulting in an “important reservoir of unused opioids available for nonmedical use . . . .” (Ref. 4). There are clinical situations that may require a supply of opioid analgesics that exceeds current CDC guidelines and FDA wants to make sure that patients have what they need in those cases. But FDA believes there are situations in which patients are prescribed an opioid analgesic when a non-opioid pain treatment would be adequate or, when an opioid product is necessary, treatment with a shorter course of therapy would be more appropriate, and without specific requirements, variance in prescribing habits are likely to persist.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Specific questions on which FDA seeks comment relating to this topic are as follows:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">1. Should FDA consider adding a recommended duration of treatment for specific types of patient needs (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> for specific types of surgical procedures) to opioid analgesic product labeling? Or, should FDA work with prescriber groups that could, in turn, develop expert guidelines on proper prescribing by indication?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">2. If opioid product labeling contained recommended duration of treatment for certain common types of patient needs, how should this information be used by FDA, other state and Federal health agencies, providers, and other intermediaries, such as health plans and pharmacy benefit managers, as the basis for making sure that opioid drug dispensing more appropriately and consistently aligns with the type of patient need for which a prescription is being written?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">3. Are there steps FDA should take with respect to dispensing and packaging (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> unit of use) to facilitate consistency of and promote appropriate prescribing practice?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">4. Are there other steps that FDA should take to help promote the prescribing of treatment durations that are appropriately tailored to a clinical patient need?

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Recently, the option of mandating education or training for health care professionals who prescribe opioid medications has been more widely discussed,<ref id="fnd2e3640" idref="fnd2e3646" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref> and some states already are, or are considering, mandating such prescriber education. For example, as of <date date="2017-07-01">July 1, 2017</date>, health care professionals in New York State who are licensed to prescribe controlled substances must complete, and register their completion of, at least 3 hours of course work or training in pain management, palliative care, and addiction (Ref. 5).

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">1. Are there circumstances under which FDA should require some form of mandatory education for health care professionals to ensure that prescribing professionals are informed about appropriate prescribing and pain management recommendations, understand how to identify the risk of abuse in individual patients, know how to get patients with a substance use disorder into treatment, and know how to prescribe treatment for—and properly manage—patients with substance use disorders, among other educational goals? Are there other steps FDA could take to educate health care professionals to ensure that prescribing professionals are informed about appropriate prescribing and pain management recommendations?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">2. How might FDA operationalize such a requirement if it were to pursue this policy goal? For example, should mandatory education apply to all prescribing health care professionals, or only a subset of prescribing health care professionals? If only a subset, how would FDA construct a framework that focuses mandatory education on only that subset—for example, by requiring mandatory education only for those writing prescriptions for longer durations as opposed to those for very short-term use?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">3. What steps should FDA take to make implementing such mandatory education efficient and more feasible? For example, should FDA work collaboratively with state public health agencies, state licensing boards, provider organizations, such as medical specialty societies and health plans, or with other stakeholders, such as <?page num="45600"?>pharmacy benefit managers, to integrate or avoid duplicating their educational programs or requirements? What other steps might FDA consider to make implementation less burdensome and more effective?

Prevention is preferable to treatment, and research on disease prevention is an important part of the NIH's mission. The knowledge gained from this research leads to stronger clinical practice, health policy, and community health programs. ODP collaborates with the NIH, other Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) agencies, and other public and private partners to achieve the Office's mission and goals. One of our priorities is to promote the use of the best available methods in prevention research and support the development of better methods. One of our strategies is to help the Center for Scientific Review (CSR) identify experts in prevention science methods to include on their review panels. This will strengthen the panels and improve the quality of the prevention research supported by the NIH. To identify experts in prevention science methods, we worked with our contractor, IQ Solutions, Inc., to develop online software which will allow us to collect scientists' names, contact information, and resumes, as well as to have those scientists identify their level of expertise in a variety of prevention science methods and content areas. The information collected with this software was used to create a web-based tool that CSR staff can use to identify scientists with expertise in specific prevention science methods and content areas for invitation to serve on one of the CSR review panels. This system will also be shared with review staff in the other Institutes and Centers at the NIH, as well as other DHHS agencies, to use in the same way. Given our plans to create an automated system for reviewer information collection, we are now seeking OMB approval for an extension and the addition of more questions.

The request also includes asking researchers who have already completed previous versions of the survey to update their information based on the revised additional topics.

By qualitative feedback USCIS means information that provides useful insights on perceptions and opinions, but not responses to statistical surveys that yield quantitative results that can be generalized to the population of study. This feedback will provide information on customer and stakeholder perceptions, experiences and expectations, provide an early warning of issues with service, and/or focus attention on areas where communication, training, or changes in operations might improve delivery of products or services. These collections will allow for ongoing, collaborative and actionable communications between the Agency and its customers and stakeholders and contribute directly to the improvement of program management. Feedback collected under this generic clearance will provide useful information, but it will not be generalized to the overall population. This data collection will not be used to generate quantitative information that is designed to yield reliably actionable results, such as monitoring trends over time or documenting program performance.

These studies and plans will empower American Indian Tribes and Tribal businesses to make informed decisions regarding their economic futures. Studies may concern the viability of an economic development project or business or the practicality of a technology a Tribe may choose to pursue. The DED will specifically exclude from consideration proposals for research and development projects, requests for funding of salaries for Tribal government personnel, funding to pay legal fees, and requests for funding for the purchase or lease of structures, machinery, hardware or other capital items. Plans may encompass future periods of five years or more and include one or more economic development factors including but not limited to land and retail use, industrial development, tourism, energy, resource development and transportation.
</p>

The DED will administer the program within IEED; and studies and plans as described herein will be sole discretionary projects DED will consider or fund absent a competitive bidding process. When funding is available, DED will solicit proposals for studies and plans. To receive these funds, Tribes may use the contracting mechanism established by <ref href="/us/pl/93/638">Public Law 93–638</ref>, the Indian Self-Determination Act or may obtain adjustments to their funding from the Office of Self-Governance. See <ref href="/us/usc/t25/s450">25 U.S.C. 450</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.</inline>

The DED expressly retains the authority to reduce or otherwise modify proposed budgets and funding amounts.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This Notice initiates the public scoping process for the EIS. The BLM intends to prepare an EIS to support the decision making for the proposed Project and conduct a public scoping period to seek input on the preliminary issues identified regarding this proposal. The Wyoming Water Development Commission proposes to enlarge the water storage capacity of Leavitt Reservoir to a total capacity of 6,604 acre feet for the purposes of multiple use that include late season irrigation, flood attenuation and recreation. A 1.5-mile sub-surface pipeline from Beaver Creek will divert water to the reservoir inlet via a 42-inch diameter pipeline across private lands. A permanent sub-surface transfer pipeline, approximately three miles long, is proposed downstream in the Beaver Creek drainage to efficiently convey reservoir release water to irrigation infrastructure.The proposal area is between the towns of Greybull and Shell, Wyoming, in the Sixth Principal Meridian, Wyoming, T. 54 N., R. 92 W., sec. 13, NW1/4SW1/4 and SW1/4SW1/4; sec. 14, NE1/4SE1/4 and SE1/4SE1/4; sec. 23, NE1/4NE1/4 and SE1/4NE1/4; sec. 24, lots 3 and 4, SW1/4NW1/4, SE1/4NW1/4, NW1/4SW1/4, NE1/4SW1/4, and SW1/4SE1/4.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Preliminary issues include: Potential impacts to wetlands and cultural sites (properties), ground and surface waters, mineral development, wildlife habitat, and the county road right-of-way. The BLM will identify, analyze, and require mitigation, as appropriate, to address the reasonably foreseeable impacts to resources from the approval of this Project. Mitigation may include avoidance, minimization, rectification, reduction or elimination over time, and compensatory mitigation; and may be considered at multiple scales, including the landscape-scale.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The BLM seeks resource information and data for public land values (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> air quality, cultural and historic resources, fire/fuels, fisheries, forestry, lands and realty, non-energy minerals and geology, oil and gas, paleontology, rangeland management, recreation, soil, water, and wildlife) in the project area. As proposed, approximately 48 percent of the project area would take place on BLM-managed public lands. The proposed dam and nearly the entirety of the expanded reservoir would reside on BLM lands. The proposed pipeline and borrow areas both cross or take place nearly in their entirety on private lands. The purpose of this request is to ensure that the project analysis has sufficient information and data to consider a reasonable range of resource uses, management options, and alternatives for managing public lands.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Please submit information to the Cody Field Manager at the address above. The BLM will treat proprietary information submissions marked as “Confidential” in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the confidentiality of such information. To provide the public with an opportunity to review the proposal and associated information, as well as any proposed plan amendments, the BLM will host meetings before <date date="2017-10-30">October 30, 2017</date>. The BLM will notify the public of meetings and any other opportunities for the public to be involved in the process for this proposal at least 15 days prior to the event. Meeting dates, locations and times will be announced by a news release to the media, individual emailings, and postings on the project Web site. The purpose of the public scoping process is to determine relevant issues that will influence the scope of the environmental analysis, including alternatives, and guide the process for developing the EIS.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The BLM will use and coordinate the NEPA commenting process to help fulfill the public involvement process under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (<ref href="/us/usc/t54/s306108">54 U.S.C. 306108</ref>), as provided for in <ref href="/us/cfr/t36/s800.2/d/3">36 CFR 800.2(d)(3)</ref>. The information about historic and cultural resources in the area potentially affected by the proposal will assist the lead agency in identifying and evaluating impacts to such resources in the context of both NEPA and Section 106 of the NHPA. Native American tribal consultations will be conducted in accordance with policy, and tribal concerns will be given due consideration. Federal, state and local agencies, along with other stakeholders that may be interested or affected by the BLM's decisions on this proposal, are invited to participate in the scoping process and, if eligible, may request or be requested by the BLM to participate as a cooperating agency.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2016-07-05">July 5, 2016</date>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the 2009 Cape Wind Energy Project Final EIS and ordered that BOEM: “supplement [the EIS] with adequate geological surveys before Cape Wind may begin construction.” <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility</inline> v. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Hopper,</inline> 827 F.3d 1077, 1084 (D.C. Cir. 2016). The Court opined that: “[w]ithout adequate geological surveys, the [BOEM] cannot `ensure that the seafloor [will be] able to support' wind turbines.” <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at 1083. While the Court found that: “[BOEM] therefore had violated NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act)” the Court noted that “. . . [it] does not necessarily mean that the project must be halted or that Cape Wind must redo the regulatory approval process.” <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at 1083–4. The Court explicitly left undisturbed BOEM's 2010 decision to issue the lease and BOEM's 2011 decision to approve the Construction and Operations Plan (COP). <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at 1084. In light of the remand order and the remaining valid lease and COP, only two alternatives remain relevant to the court's remand: The Proposed Action (affirming BOEM's issuance of the existing lease) and the No Action Alternative (BOEM rescinding the lease). In its Final SEIS, BOEM examines the available geological survey data, including the geotechnical data and reports submitted to BOEM since the 2009 Final EIS, any other relevant data that relates to the adequacy of the seafloor to support wind turbines in the lease area, and considers public comments.

The complaint as supplemented alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain height-adjustable desk platforms and components thereof by reason of infringement of U.S. Patent No. 9,113,703; U.S. Patent No. 9,277,809; and U.S. Patent No. 9,554,644. The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by section 337. The Commission's notice of investigation named Lumi Legend Corporation of Ningbo, China; Innovative Office Products LLC of Easton, Pennsylvania; Ergotech Group LLC of Easton, Pennsylvania; Monoprice, Inc. of Rancho Cucamonga, California; and Transform Partners LLC (dba Mount-It!) of San Diego, California (collectively “the Lumi Legend respondents”); Loctek Ergonomic Technology Corporation (formerly, Ningbo Loctek Visual Technology Corporation of Ningbo, China) of Ningbo, China; Zhejiang Loctek Smart Drive Technology Co., Ltd. of Ningbo, China; and Loctek Inc.'s (formerly, Zoxou, Inc. of Fremont, California) of Fremont, California (collectively herein, “Loctek respondents”).

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This ICR seeks to extend PRA authority for the information collection requirements contained in Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (PTE) 1998–54 that relates to certain employee benefit plan foreign exchange transactions executed pursuant to standing instructions. More specifically, the PTE permits certain foreign exchange transactions between employee benefit plans and certain banks and broker-dealers that are parties in interest with respect to such plans. In order that such transactions be consistent with Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) section 408(a), <ref href="/us/usc/t29/s1108">29 U.S.C. 1108</ref>/(a), requirements, the PTE imposes the following conditions at the time the foreign exchange transaction is entered into: (a) The terms of the transaction must not be less favorable than those available in comparable arm's-length transactions between unrelated parties or those afforded by the bank or the broker-dealer in comparable arm's-length transactions involving unrelated parties; (b) neither the bank nor the broker-dealer has any discretionary authority with respect to the investment of the assets involved in the transaction; (c) the bank or broker-dealer maintains at all times written policies and procedures regarding the handling of foreign exchange transactions for plans for which it is a party in interest which ensure that the party acting for the bank or the broker-dealer knows it is dealing with a plan; (d) the transactions are performed in accordance with a written authorization executed in advance by an independent fiduciary of the plan whose assets are involved in the transaction and who is independent of the bank or broker-dealer engaging in the covered transaction; (e) transactions are executed within one business day of receipt of funds; (f) the bank or the broker-dealer, at least once a day at a time specified in written procedures, establishes a rate or range of rates of exchange to be used for the transactions covered by this exemption and executes transactions at either the next scheduled time or no later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of notice of receipt of funds; (g) prior to execution of a transaction, the bank or the broker-dealer provides the authorizing fiduciary with a copy of the applicable written policies and procedures for foreign exchange transactions involving income item conversions and <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">de minimis</inline> purchases and sale transactions; (h) the bank or the broker-dealer furnishes the authorizing fiduciary a written confirmation statement with respect to each covered transaction within five (5) days of execution; (i) the bank or the broker-dealer maintains records necessary for <?page num="45618"?>plan fiduciaries, participants, and the DOL and Internal Revenue Service to determine whether the conditions of the exemption have been met for a period of six years from the date of execution of a transaction. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 section 4975 and ERISA section 408 authorize this information collection. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> <ref href="/us/usc/t26/s4975">26 U.S.C. 4975</ref>; <ref href="/us/usc/t29/s1108">29 U.S.C. 1108</ref>.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This information collection is subject to the PRA. A Federal agency generally cannot conduct or sponsor a collection of information, and the public is generally not required to respond to an information collection, unless it is approved by the OMB under the PRA and displays a currently valid OMB Control Number.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Washington State's workers' compensation system runs several promising early intervention programs including the Centers of Occupational Health and Education (COHE) and the Early Return to Work and the Stay at Work programs, which provide early intervention and return-to-work services for individuals with work-related health conditions and their employers. The <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">President's FY2018 budget proposed that</inline> the Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) at the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) jointly conduct a demonstration testing the effects of implementing key features of these programs in other states and/or for a broader population beyond workers' compensation. To do that, we anticipate funding two to three states to operate projects with key elements drawn from the Washington State programs mentioned above, with an increased emphasis on access to employment-related supports, or fund the expansion of existing programs to include increased access to employment-related supports. The ultimate policy goal is to increase employment and labor force participation of individuals who have or are developing work disabilities. This request for information (RFI) seeks public input on how the proposed demonstration projects can best be designed to promote labor force attachment, coordinate employment and health services, and support injured and ill workers in returning to and remaining at work. The input we receive will inform our deliberations about the possible design of a future demonstration project.

The ERTW program helps injured and ill workers RTW as soon as medically possible by providing access to a team of vocational services consultants, therapists, and nurse consultants to assist with developing and implementing medically appropriate RTW options. The Stay at Work program is a financial incentive program that reimburses employers for some of their costs when providing temporary, light-duty jobs for injured workers while they heal.

To do that, we anticipate funding states to operate one or more COHE-style programs, or fund the expansion of existing programs, with an increased emphasis on access to employment-related supports. The ultimate policy goal is to increase employment and labor force participation of individuals with work disabilities, and to identify and/or confirm effective strategies for doing so. For the purposes of this RFI, the term “work disability” is defined as an illness, injury, or medical condition that is anticipated to inhibit or prevent continued employment or labor force participation.

We expect that public input provided in response to this request will assist us in defining the scope and design of the demonstration project. For example, a demonstration project could test whether elements of the COHE workers' compensation model, which focus on immediate or early intervention, could be combined with re-employment services provided through the American Job Centers for the subset of participants who do not return to work within 90 days so that they could obtain additional employment services and supports to maintain a workforce attachment. The RFI specifically seeks public input on how the proposed demonstration projects can best be designed to promote labor force attachment, coordinate employment and health services, and support injured and ill workers in returning to and remaining at work.

There are six COHE centers across the state of Washington, including some housed in large medical systems and others that are community-based. Each of these centers <ref id="fnd2e8234" idref="fnd2e8242" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">8</ref> recruits and trains health care providers in their area—often orthopedists or other doctors specializing in treating workers' compensation (WC) patients. COHE started as a small pilot in two regions and has grown to currently include about 3,500 health care providers who cover about 60 percent of all WC claims in the state. Injured workers retain health care provider choice. They <?page num="45620"?>receive COHE services if they choose a COHE-affiliated provider for their care.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Given that health care providers often see relatively few patients who are at risk of labor force separation due to their illness or injury, many may have limited knowledge and resources to address the employment-related needs of this population. Health care providers affiliated with COHE, however, receive training in occupational health best practices for these cases, including the following four best practices:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">1. Submitting a complete Report of Accident (ROA) in two business days or less;

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Health service coordinators are integral to the success of the COHE model. The program is based on the MacColl chronic care model.<ref id="fnd2e8257" idref="fnd2e8263" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">9</ref> Successful health service coordinators are skilled in vocational rehabilitation and motivational interviewing and work directly with injured workers, employers, health care providers, and other stakeholders to coordinate care and RTW activities for injured workers. They also help stakeholders navigate the workers' compensation system by performing claim coordination functions, such as ensuring forms are received and complete and contacting stakeholders as needed for clarifications or follow-up. Health service coordinators frequently contact injured workers, employers, health care providers, state agency staff, and other stakeholders to help with the RTW process, and identify barriers to returning to work and resources to resolve them. The RTW activities they coordinate for the patient can include functional assessments, referrals to existing training and employment services, and setting appropriate RTW expectations. Health service coordinators also educate employers on the financial and other benefits of retaining injured workers and can refer employers to the ERTW and Stay at Work programs for resources and financial incentives to help them with job accommodation. The health service coordinators monitor all cases, but focus on those at risk for long-term disability, typically less than a quarter of all cases. The health service coordinator role is critical and depends heavily on the neutrality of health service coordinators in helping the health care and RTW system work effectively for patients, employers, health care providers, and the insurer. This neutrality allows health service coordinators to be trusted by the various stakeholders, allowing health service coordinators to maximize the likelihood of the best-case recovery and employment outcome.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The ERTW program helps injured and ill workers RTW as soon as medically possible by providing access to a team of specialists including vocational services consultants, therapist consultants, and nurse consultants who assist health care providers and employers develop and implement medically appropriate RTW options. Resources available to employers include risk management specialists, safety consultants to provide on-site consultations, and job modification funds. By providing these resources, the ERTW program speeds the worker's recovery and reduces the financial impact of a workers' compensation claim on the worker, the employer, and the workers' compensation system.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Stay at Work program incentivizes employers to offer temporary light-duty work to injured employees while they heal, by reimbursing the employers for some of the costs of providing such jobs. Eligible employers can be reimbursed for 50 percent of the base wages they pay the injured worker and some of the cost of training, tools, or clothing the worker needs to do the light-duty or transitional work.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The COHE model focuses services on the first 12 weeks after injury because this period is most critical in maximizing the likelihood of RTW. While the proposed demonstration builds upon the COHE model and the ERTW and Stay at Work programs, it differs from the original model by adding an extended focus on employment services and supports and a strong and purposeful involvement of the workforce development system.

The agencies anticipate implementing the demonstration in two to three states representing diverse programmatic contexts and with the ability to provide meaningful analyses and policy recommendations. There would be a separate technical assistance (TA) contract to assist states with implementation and a separate integrated evaluation contract to evaluate all of the sites and address specific research goals. For the purposes of this RFI, the implementation grantees are referred to as the “projects,” the technical assistance contractor is referred to as the “TA provider,” and the evaluation contractor is referred to as the “evaluator.”

Projects will be encouraged to build upon existing programs or systems, such as state-based temporary disability insurance (TDI) programs, collaborative health care organizations, disability management insurance providers, or workers' compensation programs. We would also encourage projects to think broadly about new and effective ways to prevent the development of long-term work disability. The solicitation will leave flexibility for applicants to develop their own projects that adapt to the specific programmatic, demographic, and economic contexts of their state or region while also satisfying the project's requirements.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">1. Are there potential issues with the treatment elements listed under “required treatment elements” on pages 6–7? Should any <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">not</inline> be required? What other elements might be useful, and what is the evidence base for them? What additional optional services and supports could grantees choose to include in the model? What is the existing evidence documenting the effectiveness of these additional optional services and supports?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">2. What should be the required and optional roles and responsibilities of the RTW service coordinator in implementing the treatment elements?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">3. Where should the role of a RTW service coordinator be housed in order to most effectively accomplish its goals, including an ability to maintain neutrality? For example, should service coordinators be employed by health care provider networks, by the public workforce system, by private disability insurance providers, by employers, or by another entity?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">4. Should there be educational and/or experience requirements for the RTW service coordinators, such as vocational counseling or public health backgrounds? How should these educational and experience requirements parallel and differ from those of health navigators, community health workers, and vocational rehabilitation counselors?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">5. What specific employment-related interventions should be required or allowed? What evidence supports these interventions as effective in early intervention for these populations? When referrals to existing employment-related service providers occur, will these providers have sufficient capacity and funding to provide services in a timely manner to referred individuals?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">6. The COHE model focuses interventions primarily in the first 12 weeks after injury/illness (with occasional exceptions allowing up to 26 weeks). For a demonstration such as this requiring increased involvement of the workforce development system, what is the optimal timing and length of intervention? Why, or what is the evidence base?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">7. Employment services (such as needs assessments, skill assessments, accommodations, job coaching, job search assistance if not remaining with original employer) and the public workforce system are important elements of the proposed demonstration program. What is the optimal time to provide employment services? For example, should employment services be provided during the same time window as the health care services/coordination, or afterwards? How can the RTW service coordinators best facilitate the effective use of employment services?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">8. What role should employer incentives play in this intervention? Are there particular employer incentives that we should consider in projects where workers' compensation insurance premiums play a limited role? Are there effective non-financial ways to engage and incentivize employers to support and implement SAW/RTW programs within their workplaces?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">9. What is an appropriate health care provider payment or fee structure to incentivize the specific occupational health best practices and to encourage a focus on employment as a health outcome? Are there models other than fee-for-service that would be appropriate and feasible, such as basing payments on process and/or outcome metrics? How would these models operate in the context of managed-care organizations?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">10. How can health systems and health care providers be better incentivized to consider employment a valid health outcome? What is the recent relevant evidence documenting the effectiveness of incentive models (including financial or other incentives) that include employment as an outcome?

We are particularly interested in how to define an appropriate population that is not limited to individuals with state-based <?page num="45623"?>TDI claims or WC. What are the most appropriate eligibility criteria (such as time off work, type of condition, type of employment) to identify such individuals? What kinds of “triggers” would work for the population as a mechanism for enrollment into the project?

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">17. How should project service areas be defined? For example, should demonstrations be carried out state-wide, in specific counties, regions, or local communities? Would these service areas have a large enough target population for evaluation purposes?

What is the best way to organize the structure of a demonstration like the one described above in your state? What structure would best enable effective leadership, responsibility, and accountability for the project? Would a single agency be the natural lead for the project?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">20. Similar state functions may be housed in different agencies, depending on the state. Should key functions be required, rather than specific agencies? If so, what functions should be required?

If so, what characteristics should be required of such entities? Would this be preferable to a state governmental agency serving in this role? Why or why not?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">23. The COHE model in Washington operates within a monopolistic WC system, which allows for centralized participant controls, service management, and data collection. Would states with other WC models, such as privately managed and competitive WC markets, be able to feasibly implement a similar model, particularly with regard to data collection? If so, how? Would states with short-term or temporary disability insurance programs or states with mandatory paid sick leave be able to do so, and how? In other words, should grant applicants be limited to states with specific characteristics, and why or why not?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">24. What partners, public or private, should be required or encouraged as part of the demonstration project? What other entities might be beneficial as collaborators? In what ways could they assist?

Are there research questions, not specified above, that could be answered through the evaluation which would improve understanding of ways to better serve and increase employment and labor force participation of individuals with work disabilities?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">26. What entity would be most successful in recruiting participants who have a qualifying injury or health condition (that makes them at risk for leaving the labor force)? Examples could include an insurance company, state TDI or WC insurance providers, an employer, or a health care provider.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">27. Do health systems and/or health care providers utilize risk predictors to target specific types of services? If so, which predictors are used, and for which services? Are any employment- or SAW/RTW-related?
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">28. If a cluster-randomized design is used for an experimental impact evaluation, how could the unit of randomization be defined and operationalized within various types of grantee sites? Are there other evaluation designs (randomized or not) that would be more feasible (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.</inline> quasi-experimental design)? If so, how could a potential comparison group be identified? If other randomized designs are recommended, what are potential units for random assignment and points at which assignment would occur?

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">To ensure that the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Compendium</inline> remains up to date, the Office monitors the law and Office practices. After conducting this analysis with regard to the 2014 version, the Office released a draft revision to the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Compendium</inline> on <date date="2017-06-01">June 1, 2017</date> (the “Public Draft”). The Office posted the Public Draft on its public Web site and invited comments until <date date="2017-07-30">July 30, 2017</date>. The draft included proposed revisions to the registration chapters that clarified, among other things: how and when the Office communicates with applicants; and how it handles duplicate claims, deposit requirements, and claims involving multiple works. The Public Draft also sought to provide preliminary guidance for claims involving useful articles based on the Supreme Court's recent decision in <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Star Athletica, L.L.C.</inline> v. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Varsity Brands, Inc.,</inline> 137 S. Ct. 1002 (2017). Revisions to the recordation chapter provided additional guidance for recording notices of termination, as well as information on the Office's new electronic system for designating agents for online service providers. <ref href="/us/fr/81/75695">81 FR 75695</ref> (Nov. 1, 2016). The Public Draft also explained recent regulatory changes that impact post-registration procedures, including the new “mailbox rule” for calculating dates in requests for reconsideration and new procedures for removing personally identifiable information. <ref href="/us/fr/81/62373">81 FR 62373</ref> (Sept. 9, 2016); <ref href="/us/fr/82/9004">82 FR 9004</ref> (Feb. 2, 2017). The update also incorporated changes made by the recent technical amendments to the Office's regulations. <ref href="/us/fr/82/12180">82 FR 12180</ref> (Mar. 1, 2017). An archived copy of the Public Draft is available on the Office's Web site.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Office received comments on the Public Draft from the Copyright Alliance, the Intellectual Property Owners Association (“IPO”), the Kernochan Center for Law, Media, and the Arts at Columbia Law School, as well as four individuals. After carefully reviewing these comments, the Office decided to further revise twenty-one sections of the Public Draft, resulting in a final update (the “Final Version”), as discussed in more detail below. Additionally, the Final Version reflects rulemaking activity that post-dated the Public Draft, including the Office's final rules on supplementary registration and group registration for contributions to periodicals. <ref href="/us/fr/82/27424">82 FR 27424</ref> (June 15, 2017); <ref href="/us/fr/82/29410">82 FR 29410</ref> (June 29, 2017).<ref id="fnd2e8852" idref="fnd2e8866" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref> It includes a revised Chapter 1700 that reflects the Office's new practice for amending a claim during the course of a request for reconsideration. In addition, the Office will not adopt the position in the Public Draft that, when an application deposit consists of only one copy when two are required, the effective date of registration would be based on the date the second copy was received. This would have been a departure from the Office's current <?page num="45626"?>practice, and the Office has decided to maintain its current practice (described in Chapters 600 and 1500 of the 2014 version). A complete list of all sections that have been added, amended, revised, or removed is available on the Office's Web site at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/revisions.html,</inline> along with redlines that provide a direct comparison between the Final Version and the 2014 version of the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Compendium.</inline>

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In response to a suggestion from IPO, the Office amended the Introduction to confirm that applications and documents registered or recorded on or after <date date="2017-09-29">September 29, 2017</date>, will be governed by the Final Version. The Introduction also confirms that registrations and recordations that are issued by the Office before that date will generally be governed by the 2014 version of the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Compendium,</inline> except in cases where that version had been superseded by an amendment to the regulations, intervening case law, or previously announced changes in practice.

As the Copyright Alliance noted, applicants do not need to provide a personal email address or designate a specific person to receive emails from the Office. The Office will accept communications from a general email address that may be used by multiple people within the same organization, such as “copyrightadministrator@publisher.com.” <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> Final Version, section 605.2.

This responds to the Copyright Alliance's concern that it may be too burdensome to obtain physical copies from an overseas distributor, especially if a digital copy is readily available in this country.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">IPO contended that these revisions are inconsistent with the weight of legal authority holding that a registration for a derivative work may be used to enforce the copyright in a preexisting version of the same work, even if the preexisting version has been previously published and has not been separately registered with the Office. IPO also contended that the revisions to these sections will increase the complexity of registering and enforcing the copyright in derivative computer programs, and will discourage software companies from registering their works.

The 2014 version of the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Compendium</inline> took the position that the “date of publication” is the date the work is published “under the grant,” and acknowledged that the date of publication under a particular grant may or may not be the date the work was published for the first time. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See Compendium</inline> sections 2310.3(C), 2310.3(C)(2) (3d ed. 2014).

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Public Draft amended these sections to reflect the approach adopted by a Second Circuit case, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Baldwin</inline> v. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">EMI Feist Catalog, Inc.,</inline> 805 F.3d 18, 33 (2d Cir. 2015). Specifically, the draft stated that the phrase “date of publication” means the date the work was published for the first time. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> Public Draft sections 2310.3(C), 2310.3(C)(1), 2310.3(C)(2), 2310.3(D)(1), 2310.3(D)(1)(a). The Copyright Alliance contended that this interpretation is not supported by the statute or the legislative history, and urged the Office to retain the corresponding language from the 2014 version of the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Compendium.</inline>
                                       </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">After further consideration, the Office agrees that the 2014 version represents the better reading of section 203(a)(3), and is not prepared to follow <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Baldwin</inline> in light of the limited jurisprudence on this matter. This reading is supported by both the language and structure of the statute. The terms “first published” and “first publication” are used in multiple sections of the Copyright Act, including sections 101, 104, 104A, 302, 401, 402, 406, 408, 409, 410, and 412. Presumably, Congress would have used the same terminology in section 203(a)(3) if that provision only applied to grants that convey the right to publish a work for the first time.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Indeed, the termination provision in an early copyright reform bill did provide that “if the grant covers the right of first publication of the work, the period begins at the end of 35 years from the date of first publication of the work.” H.R. 4347, 89th Cong. (1965). But the word “first” was dropped from subsequent bills, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">see</inline> H.R. 2512, 91st Cong. (1967), and it is that version of the provision that was eventually enacted as part of the Copyright Act of 1976. The legislative history shows that this change was intentional. The relevant House Report explains that the provision was specifically amended so that the provision would “apply to any publication contract, and not just to contracts involving first publication.” H.R. Rep. No. 89–2237, at 122 (1966); <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">see also</inline> H.R. Rep. No. 90–83, at 93 (1967). Accordingly, the Final Version reverts to the Office's initial interpretation reflected in the 2014 version of the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Compendium,</inline> with an additional discussion of this issue, as this interpretation is most consistent with the terms of the Copyright Act.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The 2014 version of the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Compendium</inline> states that multiple works may be registered as a unit of publication if they are physically packaged or bundled together and distributed to the public in that form. It also contains a single sentence suggesting that a “digital download” could be considered a unit of publication. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See Compendium,</inline> section 1107.1 (3d ed. 2014). The Public Draft removed this sentence because it is inconsistent with other provisions in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Compendium</inline> that clearly and repeatedly state that the unit of publication option may only be used to register works fixed and distributed in a physical format. The revision to the sentence in section 1107.1 does not represent a change in policy from the 2014 version of the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Compendium;</inline> it simply corrects a minor inconsistency in that version.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Copyright Alliance and one individual asked the Office to expand the unit of publication definition to allow applicants to register separate works that are packaged and distributed in a digital form. The Office declines to adopt this suggestion. The unit of publication option was always intended to be a narrow accommodation to account for a particular scenario: where a physical product bundles together multiple types of works of authorship as a single “unit,” and those separate works are not published individually. The paradigmatic example is a board game with playing pieces, a game board, and instructions; each of those components may be a separate work of authorship—the playing pieces may be individual sculptural works, the game board may be a pictorial or graphic work, and the instructions may be a literary work. But it would make little sense—and would be administratively burdensome on the Office—to impose the general requirement of separate applications for each work of authorship in these cases. Among other things, imposition of that rule would result in deposits that are either duplicative (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> the applicant sends the entire board game with each application) or incomplete (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> the applicant sends each element of the board game separately).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the Office's view, the same concerns are not present with respect to digital products. To begin with, the problem with duplication of deposits is significantly diminished with respect to digital works. Moreover, while it may be relatively easy for applicants and the Copyright Office to assess whether a physical product qualifies as true “unit of publication,” the same cannot readily be said for digital products, which could be distributed in a single digital file or in multiple digital files, or could readily be published only as a bundle, or both in a bundle and individually. Thus, at least at this time, the Office believes that it is inappropriate to extend the unit of publication option to digital products.<ref id="fnd2e9078" idref="fnd2e9084" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">8</ref>

The Office did not accept this suggestion. As a general rule, an applicant should prepare a separate application, filing fee, and deposit for each work that is submitted for registration. The unit of publication option is a narrow and limited exception to this <?page num=""?>rule. It provides a means for registering multiple works with one submission in cases where multiple submissions would otherwise be required and where no other statutory or regulatory accommodation exists. Often, when multiple items are fixed in the same medium of expression, they may be considered a derivative work, a compilation, or a collective work. If so, there is no need to rely on the unit of publication option, because the statute already provides a means for obtaining a registration. If applicants could register multiple works as a unit of publication whenever they happen to be fixed in the same medium of expression, the regulatory accommodation would displace the statutory scheme, and this narrow exception would become the default method for registering published works.</p>

To the extent the concern expressed in the comments relates to the inability to register multiple musical works fixed and/or distributed on an album, the Office is planning to create a new group registration option to accommodate those situations.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Copyright Alliance commented on the Public Draft's discussion of collective works. First, it asserted that more information should be included in applications for certain collective works. When registering an album together with the works on that album, the Copyright Alliance asserted that applicants should identify the complete content of the album. Specifically, the Copyright Alliance suggested that section 618.7(B)(2) should be revised to state that titles of the individual works should be included in the “Content Titles” field, even if the applicant intends to exclude one or more of those works from the claim. The Copyright Alliance said this would provide a clear record of what the album contains and makes the titles accessible in the online public record.<ref id="fnd2e9097" idref="fnd2e9103" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">9</ref>

The Office declines to adopt this suggestion, because the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Compendium</inline> already provides instructions for adding title information to a paper application. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See Compendium</inline> section 1107.4(C).</p>

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Office declines to adopt the Copyright Alliance's suggestion at this time. The Office encourages applicants to provide album information as suggested by the Copyright Alliance, but it will not require applicants for all collective works to submit all similar information. Requiring applicants to provide contents titles for an album may be feasible, but applying the same requirement to all types of collective works may be burdensome for some applicants. That said, the Office plans to revise the sections on collective works consisting of musical works and/or sound recordings in a future update to the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Compendium,</inline> and will revisit the Copyright Alliance's suggestions in making those revisions.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Additionally, the Copyright Alliance contended that the Office will not register a collective work unless it contains at least four independent works (citing <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Compendium</inline> sections 312.2, 618.7, and 803.8(F)(4)). The Copyright Alliance said this is a problem for the recording industry, because extended play albums (“EPs”) often contain two or three tracks. In such cases, the individual tracks must be registered separately. It also said this creates a workflow problem for the record labels because, although EPs are a single product, they cannot be registered in a manner that reflects the way they are commercially distributed.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Office registers “original works of authorship,” as defined in sections 102 and 103 of the Copyright Act. A compilation may be registered if it contains a sufficient amount of creative expression in the selection, coordination, and/or arrangement of its component elements. These requirements are set forth in the statute, and the Office adheres to this standard when it examines an album or any other type of compilation. The vast majority of albums contain sufficient selection, coordination, or arrangement authorship to be considered a collective work, but some albums do not satisfy this requirement. The Office recognizes that in such cases, a separate application may be required for each individual track, and that this may increase the incremental cost and effort of seeking a registration. But, contrary to the Copyright Alliance's suggestion, the Office does not have a bright line rule regarding the number of tracks that must be present to qualify as a collective work; the Office will simply scrutinize collective work applications with fewer tracks more closely to ensure they pass the necessary threshold of creativity.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Federal and non-Federal agency applicants whose development proposals are subject to statutorily-mandated Commission plan and project review must submit their proposals to the Commission following a process laid out in the Submission Guidelines. The Submission Guidelines describe the content of submissions, the submission stages, and the coordination and review process governing submissions.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The new Submission Guidelines accomplish three primary objectives: (1) Create clear, accessible, and efficient guidelines that are responsive to applicant needs; (2) Align NCPC's review stages and National Environmental Policy Act requirements with those of applicant agencies to save time and resources in the planning process; and (3) Allow staff to exempt from Commission review certain minor projects based on specific criteria where there is no federal interest. The new Submission Guidelines are posted on NCPC's Web site at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.ncpc.gov/initiatives/subnepa.html.</inline>

The two counties removed from HIDTA county designation within the Houston HIDTA are Orange and San Patricio counties in Texas.

ONDCP evaluated and accepted the request.

These two RGs were issued by the NRC staff in the 1970s to provide guidance that was considered acceptable for complying with the NRC's regulations related to the performance, evaluation, and reporting of physical inventories and material balances at fuel cycle facilities.

Although RGs 5.13 and 5.33 are withdrawn, current licensees referencing these RGs may continue to do so, and withdrawal does not affect any existing licenses or agreements.

The Exchange proposes to modify the rule to provide an OTP that chooses to utilize risk settings for its orders the option to exclude both single-legged orders and Complex Orders designated as IOC from being considered by the trade counter. To effect this change, proposed Commentary .07 to Rule 6.40–O would be amended to provide that “[a]ny OTP that activates the Risk Limitation Mechanisms for orders pursuant to Commentary .04(b) of this Rule may opt to exclude any orders (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> whether single-leg orders or Complex Orders) designated with a time-in-force of IOC from being considered by a trade counter.”

The Exchange believes that certain market participants utilize IOC orders to access liquidity on the Exchange.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange is proposing a market enhancement that would provide OTPs with greater control and flexibility over setting their risk tolerance and, potentially, more protection over risk exposure. The proposal is structured to offer the same enhancement to all OTPs, regardless of size, and would not impose a competitive burden on any participant. The Exchange does not believe that the proposed enhancement to the existing risk limitation mechanism would impose a burden on competing options exchanges. Rather, the availability of this mechanism may foster more competition. Specifically, the Exchange notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which market participants can readily favor competing venues. When an exchange offers enhanced functionality that distinguishes it from the competition and participants find it useful, it has been the Exchange's experience that competing exchanges will move to adopt similar functionality. Thus, the Exchange believes that this type of competition amongst exchanges is beneficial to the market place [sic] as a whole as it can result in enhanced processes, functionality, and technologies.

However, Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii) <ref id="fnd2e10031" idref="fnd2e10048" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">17</ref> permits the Commission to designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has asked the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay so that the Exchange can implement the proposal without delay. The Exchange believes that waiver of the operative delay would be consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest because it would enable the Exchange to implement without delay the proposed optional functionality, which the Exchange believes may, in turn, encourage more OTPs to utilize the optional risk settings for orders. Thus, the Exchange believes waiver of the operative delay would protect investors by enabling the Exchange to provide greater flexibility to its Risk Limitation Mechanisms for orders, which may result in increased usage of the risk settings to the benefit of all market participants. The Commission believes that waiver of the operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest because it will provide OTP Holders with the flexibility to exclude IOC orders from consideration by a trade counter, which, the Exchange believes, could encourage additional OTP Holders to use the risk limitation settings. As noted above, the risk limitation settings are designed to assist OTP Holders in managing risk related to submitting orders during periods of increased and significant trading activity. Under the proposal, the ability to exclude IOC orders from consideration by a trade counter is optional; thus, an OTP Holder that utilizes the risk limitation settings and wishes to continue to have its IOC orders considered by a trade counter will be able to do so. Accordingly, the Commission hereby waives the operative delay and designates the <?page num="45634"?>proposed rule change operative upon filing.<ref id="fnd2e10037" idref="fnd2e10053" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">18</ref>

The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, enacted on <date date="2012-04-05">April 5, 2012</date>, added Section 6(e) to the Securities Act. Section 6(e) of the Securities Act provides that an “emerging growth company” may confidentially submit to the Commission a draft registration statement for confidential, non-public review by the Commission staff prior to public filing, provided that the initial confidential submission and all amendments thereto shall be publicly filed not later than 21 days before the date on which the issuer conducts a road show, as such term is defined in Securities Act Rule 433(h)(4). An emerging growth company is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act as an issuer with less than $1,000,000,000 total annual gross revenues during its most recently completed fiscal year. The Trust meets the definition of an emerging growth company and consequently has submitted its Form S–1 Registration Statement on a confidential basis with the Commission.</p>

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The investment objective of the Trust will be for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of silver, less the expenses and liabilities of the Trust. The Trust will issue Shares which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Trust will not trade in silver futures or options on any futures exchange or over the counter (“OTC”) transactions in forwards, options and other derivatives. The Trust will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, “commodity interests”, or any other instruments regulated by the Commodities Exchange Act. The Trust will take delivery of physical silver that complies with the LBMA silver delivery rules.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Shares are intended to constitute a simple and cost-effective means of making an investment similar to an investment in silver. Although the Shares are not the exact equivalent of an investment in silver, they provide investors with an alternative that allows a level of participation in the silver market through the securities market.
</p>
                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Operation of the Silver Market
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The global trade in silver consists of OTC transactions in spot, forwards, and options and other derivatives, together with exchange traded futures and options.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The OTC silver market includes spot, forward, and option and other derivative transactions conducted on a principal-to-principal basis. While this is a global, nearly 24-hour per day market, its main centers are London (the biggest venue), New York and Zurich.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">According to the LBMA, the trade association that acts as the coordinator for activities conducted on behalf of its members and other participants in the London bullion market, members of the LBMA act as OTC market makers and it is believed that most OTC market trades are cleared through London. The LBMA plays an important role in setting OTC silver trading industry standards. Members of the London bullion market typically trade with each other and with their clients on a principal-to-principal basis. All risks, including those of credit, are between the two parties to a transaction. This is known as an OTC market, as opposed to an exchange-traded environment. Unlike a futures exchange, where trading is based around standard contract units, settlement dates and delivery specifications, the OTC market allows flexibility. It also provides confidentiality, as transactions are conducted solely between the two principals involved.

                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Creation and Redemption of Shares
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Trust will create and redeem Shares on a continuous basis in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares (a block of 50,000 Shares is called a “Basket”). As described below, the Trust will issue Shares in Baskets to certain authorized participants (“Authorized Participants”) on an ongoing basis. Baskets of Shares will only be issued or redeemed in exchange for an amount of silver represented by the aggregate number of Shares redeemed. No Shares will be issued unless the Custodian has allocated to the Trust's account the corresponding amount of silver. Initially, a Basket will require delivery of 50,000 fine ounces of silver. The amount of silver necessary for the creation of a Basket, or to be received upon redemption of a Basket, will decrease over the life of the Trust, due to the payment or accrual of fees and other expenses or liabilities payable by the Trust.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Baskets may be created or redeemed only by Authorized Participants. Orders must be placed by 3:59 p.m. Eastern Time (“E.T.”). The day on which a Trust receives a valid purchase or redemption order is the order date.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Each Authorized Participant must be a registered broker-dealer, a participant in Depository Trust Corporation (“DTC”), have entered into an agreement with the Trustee (the “Authorized Participant Agreement”) and have established a silver unallocated account with the Custodian or a physical silver clearing bank. The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of silver in connection with such creations or redemptions.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">According to the Registration Statement, Authorized Participants may surrender Baskets of Shares in exchange for the corresponding Basket Amount announced by the Trustee. Upon surrender of such Shares and payment of the Trustee's applicable fee and of any expenses, taxes or charges (such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees), the Trustee will deliver to the order of the redeeming Authorized Participant the amount of silver corresponding to the redeemed Baskets. Shares can only be surrendered for redemption in Baskets of 50,000 Shares each.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Before surrendering Baskets of Shares for redemption, an Authorized Participant must deliver to the Trustee a written request indicating the number of Baskets it intends to redeem. The date the Trustee receives that order determines the Basket Amount to be received in exchange. However, orders received by the Trustee after 3:59 p.m. E.T. on a business day or on a business day when the LBMA Silver Price or other applicable benchmark price is not announced, will not be accepted.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The redemption distribution from the Trust will consist of a credit to the redeeming Authorized Participant's unallocated account representing the amount of the silver held by the Trust evidenced by the Shares being redeemed as of the date of the redemption order.








 </p>
                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Net Asset Value
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The NAV of the Trust will be calculated by subtracting the Trust's expenses and liabilities on any day from the value of the silver owned by the Trust on that day; the NAV per Share will be obtained by dividing the NAV of the Trust on a given day by the number of Shares outstanding on that day. On each day on which the Exchange is open for regular trading, the Trustee will determine the NAV as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m. E.T. The Trustee will value the Trust's silver based on the most recently announced LBMA Silver Price. If the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate to use, the Sponsor will identify an alternate basis for evaluation to be employed by the Trustee. Further, the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to use on an on-going basis a different publicly available price which the Sponsor determines to fairly represent the commercial value of the Trust's silver.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The NAV per Share will be calculated by taking the current price of the Trust's total assets, subtracting any liabilities, and dividing by the total number of Shares outstanding. Authorized Participants will offer Shares at an offering price that will vary, depending on, among other factors, the price of silver and the trading price of the Shares on the Exchange at the time of offer. Authorized Participants will not receive from the Trust, the Sponsor, the Trustee or any of their affiliates any fee or other compensation in connection with the offering of the Shares.
</p>
                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Secondary Market Trading
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">While the Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of silver less the Trust's expenses and liabilities, Shares may trade at, above or below their NAV. The NAV of Shares will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Trust's assets. The trading prices of Shares will fluctuate in accordance with changes in their NAV as well as market supply and demand. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the major silver markets and the Exchange. While the Shares trade on the Exchange until 4:00 p.m. E.T., liquidity in the market for silver may be reduced after the close of the major world silver markets, including London, Zurich and COMEX. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on Shares may widen.

</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A minimum of one Basket or 50,000 Shares will be required to be outstanding at the start of trading, which is equivalent to 50,000 fine ounces of silver. The Exchange believes that the anticipated minimum number of Shares outstanding at the start of trading is sufficient to provide adequate market liquidity.

Trading in the Shares on the Exchange will occur in accordance with NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.34(a). The Exchange has appropriate rules to facilitate transactions in the Shares during all trading sessions. As provided in NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.6, Commentary .03, the minimum price variation (“MPV”) for quoting and entry of orders in equity securities traded on the NYSE Arca Marketplace is $0.01, with the exception of securities that are priced less than $1.00 for which the MPV for order entry is $0.0001.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Further, NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.201 sets forth certain restrictions on ETP Holders acting as registered Market Makers in the Shares to facilitate surveillance. Under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.201(g), an ETP Holder acting as a registered Market Maker in the Shares is required to provide the Exchange with information relating to its trading in the underlying silver, related futures or options on futures, or any other related derivatives. Commentary .04 of NYSE Arca Equities Rule 6.3 requires an ETP Holder acting as a registered Market Maker, and its affiliates, in the Shares to establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of any material nonpublic information with respect to such products, any components of the related products, any physical asset or commodity underlying the product, applicable currencies, underlying indexes, related futures or options on futures, and any related derivative instruments (including the Shares).

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As a general matter, the Exchange has regulatory jurisdiction over its ETP Holders and their associated persons, which include any person or entity controlling an ETP Holder. A subsidiary or affiliate of an ETP Holder that does business only in commodities or futures contracts would not be subject to Exchange jurisdiction, but the Exchange could obtain information regarding the activities of such subsidiary or affiliate through surveillance sharing agreements with regulatory organizations of which such subsidiary or affiliate is a member.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">With respect to trading halts, the Exchange may consider all relevant factors in exercising its discretion to halt or suspend trading in the Shares. Trading on the Exchange in the Shares may be halted because of market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in the Shares inadvisable. These may include: (1) The extent to which conditions in the underlying silver market have caused disruptions and/or lack of trading, or (2) whether other unusual conditions or circumstances detrimental to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market are present. In addition, trading in Shares will be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to the Exchange's “circuit breaker” rule.<ref id="fnd2e10541" idref="fnd2e10547" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">19</ref> The Exchange will halt trading in the Shares if the NAV of the Trust is not calculated or disseminated daily.

If the interruption to the dissemination of the IIV persists past the trading day in which it occurs, the Exchange will halt trading no later than the beginning of the trading day following the interruption.

Specifically, the Information Bulletin will discuss the following: (1) The procedures for purchases and redemptions of Shares in Baskets (including noting that Shares are not individually redeemable); (2) NYSE Arca Equities Rule 9.2(a), which imposes a duty of due diligence on its ETP Holders to learn the essential facts relating to every customer prior to trading the Shares; (3) how information regarding the IIV is disseminated; (4) the requirement that ETP Holders deliver a prospectus to investors purchasing newly issued Shares prior to or concurrently with the confirmation of a transaction; (5) the possibility that trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the Shares may widen as a result of reduced liquidity of silver trading during the Core and Late Trading Sessions after the close of the major world silver markets; and (6) trading information. For example, the Information Bulletin will advise ETP Holders, prior to the commencement of trading, of the prospectus delivery requirements applicable to the Trust. The Exchange notes that investors purchasing Shares directly from the Trust (by delivery of the Creation Basket Deposit) will receive a prospectus. ETP Holders purchasing Shares from the Trust for resale to investors will deliver a prospectus to such investors.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, the Information Bulletin will reference that the Trust is subject to various fees and expenses as will be described in the Registration Statement. The Information Bulletin will also reference the fact that there is no regulated source of last sale information regarding physical silver, that the Commission has no jurisdiction over the trading of silver as a physical commodity, and that the CFTC has regulatory jurisdiction over the trading of silver futures contracts and options on silver futures contracts.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Information Bulletin will also discuss any relief, if granted, by the Commission or the staff from any rules under the Act.

The Trust's Web site will also provide the Trust's prospectus, as well as the two most recent reports to stockholders. In addition, information regarding market price and trading volume of the Shares will be continually available on a real-time basis throughout the day on brokers' computer screens and other electronic services. Information regarding the previous day's closing price and trading volume information for the Shares will be published daily in the financial section of newspapers.

As noted above, the Exchange has in place surveillance procedures relating to trading in the Shares and may obtain information via ISG from other exchanges that are members of ISG or with which the Exchange has entered into a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. In addition, as noted above, investors will have ready access to information regarding silver pricing.

</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Exchange proposes to amend its fees at Rule 7047 to expand the features of the enterprise license set forth at Rule 7047(b)(5). The proposed changes will: (i) Allow distribution of Nasdaq Basic data to certain Professional Subscribers that are currently excluded from the license; and (ii) permit the distribution of NLS data along with Nasdaq Basic data without paying per user, per query, per visitor or per household fees. This proposal, which also includes technical and conforming changes, will increase the features of this Nasdaq Basic enterprise license without changing its fee, thereby lowering the overall cost of the product.
</p>
                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Current Fee Structure
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Nasdaq Basic provides best bid and offer and last sale information from the Nasdaq Market Center and the FINRA/Nasdaq Trade Reporting Facility (“FINRA/Nasdaq TRF”). It is a “non-core” product that provides a subset of the “core” last-sale data provided by securities information processors (“SIPs”) under the CTA Plan and the Nasdaq UTP Plan. Data is taken from three sources, which may be purchased individually or in combination: (i) Nasdaq Basic for Nasdaq, which contains the best bid and offer on the Nasdaq Market Center and last sale trade reports for Nasdaq and the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF for Nasdaq-listed stocks; (ii) Nasdaq Basic for NYSE, which contains the best bid and offer on the Nasdaq Market Center and last sale trade reports for Nasdaq and the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF for NYSE-listed stocks; and (iii) Nasdaq Basic for NYSE MKT, which contains the best bid and offer on the Nasdaq Market Center and last sale trade reports for Nasdaq and the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF for stocks listed on NYSE MKT and other listing venues whose quotes and trade reports are disseminated on Tape B.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">User fees for Nasdaq Basic may be paid through per Subscriber monthly charges, per query fees, or two types of enterprise licenses: An internal enterprise license for Professional Subscribers at Rule 7047(b)(4) (for $365,000 per month); and an enterprise license for Non-Professional and Professional Subscribers with whom the broker-dealer has a brokerage relationship at Rule 7047(b)(5) (for $100,000 per month). The Exchange proposes to modify the second of these two enterprise licenses, at Rule 7047(b)(5), which allows the distribution of Nasdaq Basic, or Derived Data therefrom, to Professional and Non-Professional Subscribers who are natural persons and with whom the broker-dealer has a brokerage relationship. As a current condition of this license, Professional Users [sic] who receive data may not use that data within the scope of any professional engagement or registration. In addition, Nasdaq must approve any electronic system used to distribute such data, and a separate enterprise license must be purchased for each such system. Broker-dealers purchasing this license must also report the number of Subscribers at least once per year.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As noted above, the Exchange proposes to add NLS data as an additional feature to the Nasdaq Basic enterprise license at Rule 7047(b)(5). NLS provides real-time last sale information, including price, volume, and time of execution, for transactions on the Nasdaq Market Center or reported to the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF.<ref id="fnd2e10820" idref="fnd2e10830" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">3</ref> It is, like Nasdaq Basic, a non-core product that provides a subset of the core data provided by the SIPs under the CTA Plan and the Nasdaq UTP Plan. NLS was designed to “increase[ ] the availability of NASDAQ proprietary market data to individual investors.” <ref id="fnd2e10824" idref="fnd2e10841" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">4</ref> The Exchange does not explicitly offer an enterprise license for NLS, but has set a cap of $41,500 per month for NLS for Nasdaq and NLS for NYSE/NYSE MKT.

</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As explained above, the proposed changes will expand the features of the enterprise license set forth at Rule 7047(b)(5) by: (i) Allowing distribution of Nasdaq Basic data to certain Professional Users [sic] that are currently excluded from the license; and (ii) permitting the distribution of NLS data, along with Nasdaq Basic data, without paying per user, per query, per visitor or per household fees. The proposal will also include technical and conforming changes as described below.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The enterprise license at Rule 7047(b)(5) currently allows distribution of data to Professionals in the context of a brokerage relationship with the broker-dealer, and explicitly prohibits Professionals who receive data under that license from using it within the scope of a professional engagement or registration. The Exchange proposes to loosen that restriction by allowing the broker-dealer to make Nasdaq Basic data available to up to and including 4,500 internal Subscribers operating on approved electronic system for use by Professionals who work for the broker-dealer and use that data to provide brokerage services to investors. Use of the license for internal Subscribers will be limited to Professionals providing brokerage services to investors, but will not be available to any Professionals involved in proprietary trading, surveillance activities, or performing any other function solely for the benefit of the broker-dealer. Internal Subscribers may operate only on an approved electronic system to ensure that appropriate controls are in place to prevent use of the data by unauthorized personnel or for impermissible purposes. Any distribution to over 4,500 internal Subscribers, or any usage by Professional Users [sic] not in support of brokerage services to investors on an approved platform, would be subject to the applicable fees set forth in Rule 7047(b).






 </p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The difference between internal distribution of Nasdaq Basic through the <?page num="45641"?>newly proposed $100,000 enterprise license at Rule 7047(b)(5), and internal distribution under the existing $365,000 license under Rule 7047(b)(4), is of magnitude and scope. The new license will be limited to 4,500 internal Professional Subscribers, whereas the number of internal Subscribers able to obtain data under the $365,000 enterprise license is not so limited.<ref id="fnd2e10868" idref="fnd2e10874" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">5</ref> In addition, use of the data by internal Professional Users [sic] under the proposed license will be limited to the provision of brokerage services to investors, whereas use of the data through the $365,000 license under Rule 7047(b)(4) is not limited to such services. Under the proposed rule, Professional Subscribers who do not obtain Nasdaq Basic through internal distribution, but rather through their own brokerage relationship with the broker-dealer, will still be prohibited from using such data within the scope of any professional engagement.

All of these changes are necessary to support the primary fee changes sought by the Exchange, or to correct technical errors. The change in reporting is necessary to monitor the number of internal Subscribers receiving data. The clarification to the ability of Professionals to utilize Nasdaq Basic data is necessary to allow Professionals to effectively use the data in support of providing brokerage services to investors. The change from NASDAQ to Nasdaq is necessary to replace an older version of the Exchange's name.

The cost of the license will remain $100,000 per month, but services will be augmented by allowing internal distribution to up to 4,500 Professionals and including distribution of NLS to private investors. The proposal will lower the costs to broker-dealers of distributing Nasdaq Basic and NLS, thereby encouraging the dissemination of such data to individual investors.

As described above, the proposed changes will: (i) Allow distribution of Nasdaq Basic data to certain Professional Subscribers that are currently excluded from the license; and (ii) permit the distribution of NLS data along with Nasdaq Basic data without paying per user, per query, per visitor or per household fees. The proposal will provide greater value to the broker-dealers purchasing the enterprise license, and increase market transparency by lowering the cost of distributing both NLS and Basic to <?page num="45642"?>investors. The proposal is an equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges because the services will be the same for all broker-dealers that purchase the license. The services are not designed to permit unfair discrimination because all broker-dealers will be able to purchase the same license at the same price. As is the case for the current enterprise licenses, offering the enterprise license only to broker-dealers is not unfair discrimination because the license is primarily designed to allow data distribution to investors, and investors execute trades through broker-dealers. It is reasonable to limit use of the expanded enterprise license to internal Subscribers operating on approved platforms to ensure that the data is being used to support brokerage services for investors, rather than any other purpose. Moreover, enterprise license fees, like all market data fees, are constrained by the Exchange's need to compete for order flow, and are subject to competition from other exchanges and among broker-dealers for customers. If Nasdaq is incorrect in its assessment of price, it may lose market share as a result.

</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. In terms of inter-market competition, the Exchange notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which market participants can readily favor competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be excessive, or rebate opportunities available at other venues to be more favorable. In such an environment, the Exchange must continually adjust its fees to remain competitive with other exchanges and with alternative trading systems that have been exempted from compliance with the statutory standards applicable to exchanges. Because competitors are free to modify their own fees in response, and because market participants may readily adjust their order routing practices, the Exchange believes that the degree to which fee changes in this market may impose any burden on competition is extremely limited.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed changes will effectively lower the cost to broker-dealers to distribute NLS and Nasdaq Basic by expanding the features of the enterprise license set forth at Rule 7047(b)(5) without increasing fees. This proposal to lower costs is itself evidence of the need to maintain low prices is [sic] a competitive marketplace. Accordingly, the Exchange does not believe that the proposed changes will impair the ability of members or competing order execution venues to maintain their competitive standing in the financial markets.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Market forces constrain the prices for NLS and Nasdaq Basic in two respects. First, market data fees are one element of the total cost of interacting with the Exchange and, if the price of these products were set above competitive levels, competition for order flow would be harmed. Second, the competition among broker-dealers for customers will provide another constraint on the cost of NLS and Nasdaq Basic.
</p>
                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Competition for Order Flow
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Market data fees are constrained by competition among exchanges and other entities seeking to attract order flow. Order flow is the “life blood” of the exchanges. Broker-dealers currently have numerous alternative venues for their order flow, including self-regulatory organization (“SRO”) markets, as well as internalizing broker-dealers and various forms of alternative trading systems (“ATSs”), including dark pools and electronic communication networks (“ECNs”). Each SRO market competes to produce transaction reports via trade executions, and two FINRA-regulated TRFs compete to attract internalized transaction reports. The existence of fierce competition for order flow implies a high degree of price sensitivity on the part of broker-dealers, which may readily reduce costs by directing orders toward the lowest-cost trading venues.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The level of competition and contestability in the market for order flow is demonstrated by the numerous examples of entrants that swiftly grew into some of the largest electronic trading platforms and proprietary data producers: Archipelago, Bloomberg Tradebook, Island, RediBook, Attain, TracECN, BATS Trading and BATS/Direct Edge. A proliferation of dark pools and other ATSs operate profitably with fragmentary shares of consolidated market volume. For a variety of reasons, competition from new entrants, especially for order execution, has increased dramatically over the last decade.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Each SRO, TRF, ATS, and broker-dealer that competes for order flow is permitted to produce proprietary data products. Many currently do or have announced plans to do so, including NYSE, NYSE Amex, NYSE Arca, BATS, and IEX. This is because Regulation NMS deregulated the market for proprietary data. While broker-dealers had previously published their proprietary data individually, Regulation NMS encourages market data vendors and broker-dealers to produce proprietary products cooperatively in a manner never before possible. Order routers and market data vendors can facilitate production of proprietary data products for single or multiple broker-dealers. The potential sources of proprietary products are virtually limitless.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The markets for order flow and proprietary data are inextricably linked: a trading platform cannot generate market information unless it receives trade orders. As a result, the competition for order flow constrains the prices that platforms can charge for proprietary data products. Firms make decisions on how much and what types of data to consume based on the total cost of interacting with Nasdaq and other exchanges. The cost of market data is one factor in this total platform analysis. A supracompetitive price for NLS and Nasdaq Basic has the potential to impair competition for order flow, and the need to compete effectively for order flow will constrain its price.

</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Broker-dealers that purchase NLS and Nasdaq Basic are in competition for customers. If the price of these products were set above competitive levels, the broker-dealers that purchase these products would be at a disadvantage relative to their competitors. As such, they may lower costs by curtailing their purchases of Nasdaq products, thereby providing a constraint on the price of NLS and Nasdaq Basic.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In summary, market forces constrain the price of NLS and Nasdaq Basic through competition for order flow and in the competition among broker-dealers for customers. For these reasons, the Exchange has provided a substantial basis for demonstrating that the fee is equitable, fair, reasonable, and not unreasonably discriminatory, and that it is therefore consistent with and in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act

According to the Exchange, circumstances may arise in which the NYSE Arca Core Trading Session is in progress, but trading in Futures Contracts is not occurring. Such circumstances may result from reasons including, but not limited to, a futures exchange having a separate holiday schedule than the NYSE Arca, a futures exchange closing prior to the close of the NYSE Arca, price fluctuation limits being reached in a Futures Contract, or a futures exchange, imposing any other suspension or limitation on trading in a Futures Contract. In such instances, for IFV calculation purposes, the price of the applicable Futures Contracts, as well as Financial Instruments whose price is derived from the Futures Contracts, would be static or priced by the Fund at the applicable early cut-off time of the exchange trading the applicable Futures Contract. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> Amendment No. 2, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">supra</inline> note 9, at 7 n.13.</p>

If the interruption to the dissemination of the IFV or the value of the Benchmark persists past the trading day in which it occurred, the Exchange will halt trading no later than the beginning of the trading day following the interruption. Trading in Shares of a Fund will be halted if the circuit breaker parameters in NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.12 have been reached.

In addition, the Exchange notes that the proposed rule change would clarify the scope of its limitation of liability rule, including the elimination of daily liability caps and applicable procedural requirements, for all ETP Holders, OTP Holders, and OTP Firms, and ensure that all Exchange permit holders would be subject to the same rule.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Exchange proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .06 to Rule 6.2B (Hybrid Opening (and Sometimes Closing) System (“HOSS”)) to establish its aftermarket procedure for generating two-sided indicative values in certain series of SPX options (including series of SPX and SPXW). Specifically, proposed paragraph (a) would contain the current text of Interpretation and Policy .06 to Rule 6.2B, which the Exchange is not proposing to change, regarding the Exchange's end-of-month process for disseminating after the close of trading bid and offer quotations that reflect a designated Lead Market-Maker's (“LMM's”) calculated theoretical fair value of non-expiring series of SPX options as of time of the close of trading in the underlying cash market on the last business day of each calendar month. Proposed paragraph (b) of Interpretation and Policy .06 to Rule 6.2B would establish the Exchange's process for generating two-sided indicative values for non-expiring series of SPX options when the Exchange determines that it is necessary to publish such values in the interests of fair and orderly markets on trading days other than the final business day of a calendar month. The specific provisions of proposed paragraph (b) to Interpretation and Policy .06 to Rule 6.2B are discussed in detail below.

In addition, Rule 6.2 expressly provides that the DPM or LMM appointed in the class may, with the approval of senior Help Desk personnel, deviate from any rotation policy or procedure issued by the Exchange. Such deviations from normal policies and procedures may include, for example, determinations to employ abbreviated closing rotation procedures pursuant to Interpretation and Policy .04 to Rule 6.2.

Under Rule 6.2B(h), the Exchange may decide to employ a closing rotation in a series after the end of the normal close of any trading session whenever the Exchange concludes that such action is appropriate in the interests of a fair and orderly market. Similar to Interpretation and Policy .02 to Rule 6.2, the list of factors that may be considered in determining whether to hold a closing rotation procedure include, but are not limited to, whether there has been a recent opening or reopening of trading in the underlying security, a declaration of a fast market, or a need for a closing procedure in connection with expiring individual security options, an end of the year procedure, or the restart of a procedure which is already in progress. Rule 6.2B(g) provides that senior Help Desk personnel and senior management may deviate from the standard manner of conducting a closing rotation in any option class if necessary in the interests of maintaining a fair and orderly market.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In general, the Exchange's end-of-day bid and offer quotations are determined based on actual bids and offers displayed in market as of the close of trading on the Exchange. These final end-of-day bids and offer are used by various market participants, which may include broker-dealers, mutual funds, hedge funds, advisory firms, and clearing houses, for different business and risk-related functions such as portfolio performance analyses, daily profit and loss reports. On certain trading days, however, market conditions may cause Market-Makers to widen or remove their quotes from the market during the final moments of trading in order to mitigate the risk and uncertainty associated with carrying overnight positions and the possibility of hedges being unavailable to offset such risk after the close of trading. Additionally, synchronization issues may cause Market-Makers to widen or remove their quotes from the market during the final moments of trading if their feed from the underlying futures markets are not synchronized with the Exchange's close of trading. In these instances, resulting quotations may not reflect true market pricing, which may artificially affect the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) of mutual funds, portfolio managers' performance indicators, and institutional and retail capital requirements. Consistent with the discretion afforded to the Exchange under Rules 6.2A, 6.2B, and 24.13, as discussed above, the Exchange may conduct special closing procedures to ensure that the end-of-day pricing is consistent with actual market conditions as of the close of trading if it concludes that deviation from the Exchange's standard closing procedures is appropriate in the interests of fair and orderly markets. In such cases, in addition to publishing the actual end-of-day bid and offer quotations displayed in market as of the close of trading, the Exchange provides notice to Trading Permit Holders (“TPHs”) that a second set of quotations, determined based on an objectively selected Market-Maker's algorithmically generated bid and offer quotations in affected series, will be disseminated after the close of trading pursuant to special closing procedures. In an effort to enhance and increase transparency around the end-of-day process, the Exchange proposes to change the way that it deals with wide and absent quotations in non-expiring series of SPX on days other than the final business day of each calendar month by adding to the Rules a procedure for disseminating clearly marked two-sided indicative values, derived from previously displayed firm quotations and orders or generally accepted volatility and options pricing models after the close of trading.

Specifically, proposed paragraph (b) of Interpretation and Policy .06 to Rule 6.2B would provide that following the close of trading on any trading day that is not the last business day of a calendar month, in addition to the Exchange's regular end-of-day quotations, the Exchange may determine, on a series-by-series basis, to disseminate two-sided indicative values in non-expiring series of SPX options in the interests of fair and orderly markets. Under the proposed rule, the determination to disseminate two-sided end-of-day indicative values would be made by the Exchange based on various sets of objective criteria such as the absence of any bid or offer in the series, whether the bid-ask differential in a series is unreasonably or extraordinarily wide in relation to the quote widths that existed in series during trading, or whether the midpoint between the quotes in the series moved by a certain amount within the final moments of trading.<ref id="fnd2e12233" idref="fnd2e12239" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">11</ref>

The Exchange notes that quotes and orders that meet the reasonability criteria typically exist within 15 minutes of the close of trading. In the absence of quotes and orders in the series that meet the objective reasonability criteria, two-sided indicative values would be generated using generally accepted volatility and options pricing models (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> Black Scholes) as determined by the Exchange. The Exchange would apply the model to a set of data points (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.</inline> displayed quotations and orders) over a period of time prior to the close of trading to calculate implied volatility for all series within the data set and generate a volatility surface.

Using the derived volatility surface and ensuring that prices do not cross through closing bid/ask quotes (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> model-generated price cannot be lower than the market's highest bid price or greater than the lowest offer price), the Exchange would back out midpoint prices for all series and then generate two-sided indicative values around those midpoints, and the created spread would vary depending on series. Two-sided indicative values would be disseminated via the Options Price Reporting Authority (“OPRA”) and CBOE Streaming Markets (“CSM”). Consistent with the last sentence of proposed Interpretation and Policy .06(b) to Rule 6.2B, which provides that two-sided indicative values would be clearly identified in an appropriate manner as determined by the Exchange, two-sided indicative values would be sent to OPRA with a specific message indicator (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.</inline> message type “I”) that has been adopted by OPRA solely for the purpose of disseminating after-market indicative value information. Pursuant to OPRA message specifications, the new “I” message type would only be applicable to and active for messages sent after the close of trading of regular trading hours, which would be enforced to only allow “I” messages to be disseminated after 4:15 p.m. ET. The “I” indicator will not be disseminated for quotes generated during an extended trading hours session. The Exchange has communicated and worked with other OPRA reporting entities to ensure that within the industry, the transmission of aftermarket messages types marked “I” is defined within the OPRA message specifications and understood to be used to delineate informational two-sided indicative values. Pursuant to the proposed rule text, these OPRA message specifications and the “I” indicator would be further described and communicated to market participants via Regulatory Circular.

The Exchange believes that the proposed procedure is a reasonable procedure permitting the Exchange to disseminate informational indicative values more reflective of actual options values in addition to final end-of-day displayed quotations when members' systems issues or market conditions result in an absence of final quotes or extraordinarily wide final quotes without interfering in the markets or impeding any market functionalities that rely on accurate pricing or end-of-day quotes. The Exchange believes that such procedures may be especially appropriate given the fact that wide or no-bid closing prices may be a reflection of prudent risk control measures, which may cause market participants to widen or pull quotations from the market prior to the close of trading in order to avoid carrying overnight positions or taking on positions while appropriate hedging instruments are unavailable. The Exchange also believes that its proposal is consistent with the Commission's recent emphasis on the need for exchanges to adopt measures to protect investors by dampening the effects of unrepresentative market volatility on market participants.<ref id="fnd2e12301" idref="fnd2e12307" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">15</ref>

Rather, the Exchange is simply proposing to make additional information available to market participants under certain circumstances in which such information may be informative or useful. This information would not be disseminated during trading hours and would be clearly marked to denote that it is informational only. The Exchange also believes that its proposal is consistent with current Rules 6.2, 6.2A, 6.2B and 24.13, which provide that the Exchange may, in the interests of a fair and orderly market, decide to employ the end-of-day indicative value process after the normal close of a trading session.

As such, IOC orders are never ranked (as resting interest) in the Consolidated Book. The Exchange believes that certain OTPs [sic] utilize IOC orders to access liquidity on the Exchange. Thus, the proposed change is designed to accommodate participants that utilize IOCs in this manner by enabling them to exclude IOC orders from being counted and avoid potentially triggering their risk settings (prematurely), resulting in the cancellation of open orders. The Exchange believes that providing ATP Holders this additional flexibility may encourage more ATP Holders to utilize the risk settings, which benefits all market participants. The Exchange also believes that the proposed change would result in risk settings that may be better calibrated to suit the needs of certain ATP Holders (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> those that routinely utilize IOC orders to access liquidity on the Exchange), which improved risk settings should encourage ATP Holders to direct additional order flow and liquidity to the Exchange.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change removes impediments to and perfects the mechanism of a free and open market by providing ATP Holders greater control and flexibility over setting their risk tolerance, which may enhance the efficacy of the risk settings. By their terms, IOC orders (or portions thereof) will cancel if not immediately executed. As such, IOC orders are never ranked (as resting interest) in the Consolidated Book. The Exchange believes that <?page num="45655"?>certain market participants utilize IOC orders to access liquidity on the Exchange. Thus, the proposed change is designed to accommodate participants that utilize IOCs in this manner by enabling them to exclude IOC orders from being counted and avoid potentially triggering their risk settings (prematurely), resulting in the cancellation of open orders. The Exchange believes that providing ATP Holders this additional flexibility may encourage more ATP Holders to utilize the risk settings, which benefits all market participants. Further, the proposed change would promote just and equitable principles of trade because it would result in risk settings that may be better calibrated to suit the needs of certain OTPs [sic] (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> those that routinely utilize IOC orders to access liquidity on the Exchange), which improved risk settings should encourage ATP Holders to direct additional order flow and liquidity to the Exchange. To the extent additional order flow is submitted to the Exchange as a result of the proposed change, all market participants stand to benefit from increased trading.<ref id="fnd2e12648" idref="fnd2e12654" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">15</ref>

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This proposed change, which was specifically requested by some ATP Holders, would foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in, securities as it will be available to all OTPs [sic] on an optional basis and may encourage more ATP Holders to utilize this enhanced functionality to [sic] benefit of all market participants. Because the risk controls are designed to prevent the execution of erroneously priced trades, the Exchange believes that any proposal designed to increase the number of ATP Holders that utilize the functionality would benefit all market participants.

</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange is proposing a market enhancement that would provide ATP Holders with greater control and flexibility over setting their risk tolerance and, potentially, more protection over risk exposure. The proposal is structured to offer the same enhancement to all ATP Holders, regardless of size, and would not impose a competitive burden on any participant. The Exchange does not believe that the proposed enhancement to the existing risk limitation mechanism would impose a burden on competing options exchanges. Rather, the availability of this mechanism may foster more competition. Specifically, the Exchange notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which market participants can readily favor competing venues. When an exchange offers enhanced functionality that distinguishes it from the competition and participants find it useful, it has been the Exchange's experience that competing exchanges will move to adopt similar functionality. Thus, the Exchange believes that this type of competition amongst exchanges is beneficial to the market place [sic] as a whole as it can result in enhanced processes, functionality, and technologies.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A proposed rule change filed pursuant to Rule 19b–4(f)(6) under the Act <ref id="fnd2e12697" idref="fnd2e12711" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">18</ref> normally does not become operative for 30 days after the date of its filing. However, Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii) <ref id="fnd2e12701" idref="fnd2e12716" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">19</ref> permits the Commission to designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has asked the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay so that the Exchange can implement the proposal without delay. The Exchange believes that waiver of the operative delay would be consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest because it would enable the Exchange to implement without delay the proposed optional functionality, which the Exchange believes may, in turn, encourage more ATP Holders to utilize the optional risk settings for orders. Thus, the Exchange believes waiver of the operative delay would protect investors by enabling the Exchange to provide greater flexibility to its Risk Limitation Mechanisms for orders, which may result in increased usage of the risk settings to the benefit of all market participants. The Commission believes that waiver of the operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest because it will provide ATP Holders with the flexibility to exclude IOC orders from consideration by a trade counter, which, the Exchange believes, could encourage additional ATP Holders to use the risk limitation settings. As noted above, the risk limitation settings are designed to assist ATP Holders in managing risk related to submitting orders during periods of increased and significant trading activity. Under the proposal, the ability to exclude IOC orders from consideration by a trade counter is optional; thus, an ATP Holder that utilizes the risk limitation settings and wishes to continue to have its IOC orders considered by a trade counter will be able to do so. Accordingly, the Commission hereby waives the operative delay and designates the proposed rule change operative upon filing.<ref id="fnd2e12705" idref="fnd2e12721" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">20</ref>

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The following is a brief overview of the request: The Lancaster Airport Authority has submitted a land release request seeking to change the designation of 2.799 acres of on-airport property from aeronautical to non-aeronautical use. It is proposed that this acreage be leased to a developer that will use the land to construct and operate a convenience store. The proposed duration of the leasehold is 50 years. No land shall be sold as part of this land request. The property is situated on the northwest corner of the intersection of Lititz Pike (Route 501) and Airport Road in Warwick Township. The 2.799 acres are part of a 14.65-acre parcel that was purchased by the sponsor in 1959 with funding from the FAA as part of a Federal grant to protect the runway approach from incompatible development. The subject area itself, however, is located outside the designated Runway Protection Zone (RPZ) and the proposed development does not penetrate the protected surfaces established by <ref href="/us/cfr/t14/p77">14 CFR part 77</ref>. The 2.799-acre area requested to be designated as non-aeronautical is impractical to be utilized for aviation purposes because it is located outside the Air Operations Area (AOA), behind a row of corporate hangars. A large stormwater drainage swale separates the site from the AOA. The subject acreage is not currently being utilized by the Airport Authority. The purpose of this request is to permanently change the designation of the property given there is no potential for future aviation use, as demonstrated by Lancaster Airport's approved Airport Layout Plan. Subsequent to the implementation of the proposed redesignation, rents received by the airport from this property must be used in accordance with FAA's Policy and Procedures Concerning the Use of Airport Revenue, published in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> on <date date="1999-02-16">February 16, 1999</date>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Any person may inspect the request by appointment at the FAA office address listed above. Interested persons are invited to comment. All comments will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(a) The tires covered by this petition are labeled with incorrect information regarding the number of tread plies and in two cases, the incorrect and/or missing ply material. However, this mislabeling has no impact on the operational performance of these tires or on the safety of vehicles on which these tires are mounted. The subject tires meet or exceed all of the performance requirements specified by FMVSS No. 139.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(b) NHTSA has concluded in response to numerous other petitions that this type of noncompliance is inconsequential to safety.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">CTA concluded by expressing the belief that the subject noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and that its petition to be exempted from providing notification of the noncompliance, as required by <ref href="/us/usc/t49/s30118">49 U.S.C. 30118</ref>, and a remedy for the noncompliance, as required by <ref href="/us/usc/t49/s30120">49 U.S.C. 30120</ref>, should be granted.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">To view CTA's petition analyses and test data in its entirety you can visit <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.regulations.gov</inline> by following the online instructions for accessing the dockets and by using the docket ID number for this petition shown in the heading of this notice.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NHTSA notes that the statutory provisions (<ref href="/us/usc/t49/s30118/d">49 U.S.C. 30118(d)</ref> and 30120(h)) that permit manufacturers to file petitions for a determination of inconsequentiality allow NHTSA to exempt manufacturers only from the duties found in sections 30118 and 30120, respectively, to notify owners, purchasers, and dealers of a defect or noncompliance and to remedy the defect or noncompliance. Therefore, any decision on this petition only applies to the subject tires that CTA no longer controlled at the time it determined that the noncompliance existed. However, any decision on this petition does not relieve equipment distributors and dealers of the prohibitions on the sale, offer for sale, or introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of the noncompliant tires under their control after CTA notified them that the subject noncompliance existed.

The BEA Program is administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund). Through the BEA Program, the CDFI Fund awards formula-based grants to depository institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for increasing their levels of loans, investments, Service Activities, and technical assistance within Distressed Communities, and financial assistance to certified Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) through equity investments, equity-like loans, grants, stock purchases, loans, deposits, and other forms of financial and technical assistance, during a specified period.

Since its creation in 1994, the CDFI Fund has awarded more than $2.3 billion to CDFIs, community development organizations, and financial institutions through the Community Development Financial Institutions Program (CDFI Program), the Native American CDFI Assistance Program (NACA Program), and the BEA Program. In addition, the CDFI Fund has allocated $50.5 billion in tax credit allocation authority to Community Development Entities through the New Markets Tax Credit Program (NMTC Program), guaranteed bonds in the total amount of $1.1 billion through the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program, and awarded more than $171 million through the Capital Magnet Fund. The BEA Program complements the community development activities of banks and thrifts (collectively referred to as banks for purposes of this NOFA) by providing financial incentives to expand investments in CDFIs and to increase lending, investment, and Service Activities within Distressed Communities. Providing monetary awards to banks for increasing their community development activities leverages the CDFI Fund's dollars and puts more capital to work in Distressed Communities throughout the nation.

The regulations governing the BEA Program can be found at <ref href="/us/cfr/t12/p1806">12 CFR part 1806</ref> (the Interim Rule). The Interim Rule provides the evaluation criteria and other requirements of the BEA Program. Detailed BEA Program requirements are also found in the application materials associated with this NOFA (the <?page num="45664"?>Application). The CDFI Fund encourages interested parties and Applicants to review the authorizing statute, Interim Rule, this NOFA, the Application, and the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Requirements) for a complete understanding of the Program.

When evaluating award applications, awarding agencies must evaluate the risks to the program posed by each applicant, and each applicant's merits and eligibility. These requirements are designed to ensure that applicants for Federal assistance receive a fair and consistent review prior to an award decision. This review will assess items such as the Applicant's financial stability, quality of management systems, history of performance, and audit findings. In addition, the Uniform Requirements include guidance on audit requirements and other award requirements with which Recipients must comply.

Persisent Poverty Counties (PPCs) are defined as any county that has had 20 percent or more of its population living in poverty over the past 30 years, as measured by the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses, and the most recent series of 5-year data available from the American Community Survey from the Census Bureau. The tabular BEA Program Eligibility Data which is located on the CDFI Fund's Web site has been updated and now indicates whether a census tract also meets “Persistent Poverty County” criteria. Applicants that apply under this NOFA will be required to indicate the minimum and maximum percentage of the BEA Program Award that the Applicant will commit to investing in PPCs.

Therefore, the CDFI Fund encourages Applicants to submit the Grant Application Package as early as possible. This will help to ensure that the Grant Application Package is validated before the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Grants.gov</inline> submission deadline and provide time for Applicants to contact <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Grants.gov</inline> directly to resolve any submission issues since the CDFI Fund does not administer or maintain that system.

The regulation provides that a holder may make an election to amortize bond premium by offsetting interest income with bond premium, and the holder must attach a statement to their tax return providing certain information. The regulation also provides that a taxpayer may receive automatic consent to change its method of accounting for premium provided the taxpayer attaches a statement to its tax return. The information requested is necessary for the IRS to determine whether an issuer or a holder has changed its method of accounting for premium.
