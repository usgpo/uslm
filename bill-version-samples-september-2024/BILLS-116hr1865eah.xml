The guidance shall provide further (i) that the section 403(b)(7) status of the distributed custodial account is generally maintained if the custodial account thereafter adheres to the requirements of section 403(b) that are in effect at the time of the distribution of the account and (ii) that a custodial account would not be considered distributed to the participant or beneficiary if the employer has any material retained rights under the account (but the employer would not be treated as retaining material rights simply because the custodial account was originally opened under a group contract).
