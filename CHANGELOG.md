## Approved Changes ##

1.0.18 - Current version - Update for House Manual and the addition of a version attribute. Moved to old folder in the proposed branch. 

## Proposed Changes ##

2.0.4 - Draft version of uslm-2.0.4.xsd with added repealAndReserve amending action type, added support for nested lists, and signatures allowed at the end of levels. The “repealAndReserve” amending action type was added because we encountered a combined action within FR amendments. The support for nested lists was added because we encountered nested lists on the regulatory side, but not previously on the legislative side. The support for signatures at the end of levels was added because FR rules contain these when a rule involves multiple agencies.

2.0.3 - Superseded draft version uslm-2.0.3.xsd with updates for enrolled bills, public laws, Statutes at Large, Federal Register, and Code of Federal Regulations including use of processing instructions for white space and the foreign element for use in regulatory data.

2.0.0 - Superseded draft version - uslm-2.0.0.xsd with updates for enrolled bills, public laws, Statutes at Large, Federal Register, and Code of Federal Regulations. Moved to old folder in the proposed branch.
