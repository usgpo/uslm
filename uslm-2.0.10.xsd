         ======================================================================
         * United States Legislative Model (USLM)*
         ====================================================================== 
         
         ** Objective ** 
         
         This schema provides a general schema for modeling United States
         legislative and regulatory documents, including:
           * United States Code titles and appendices.
           * Enrolled Bills
           * Public Laws
           * Statutes at Large
           * Statute Compilations
           * Federal Register
           * Code of Federal Regulations
         It is designed to be extendable to future legislative and regulatory
         documents. The intent is to support XML data delivery, publishing, 
         editing, and automated processing of the documents.
         
         The schema in intended to be extensible to model bills, resolutions,
         statutes, amendments, and other legislative documents.
         
         This schema is not intended to model executive branch or judicial
         branch documents, except as this content is included in the documments
         that are within scope.
         
         ** Understanding this Schema ** 
         
         This schema is designed in several layers. The best way to learn the 
         schema is to first understand the fundamental building blocks and then
         to build your understanding one layer at a time. The order of 
         declaration and definitions is generally the best order to learn it as
         well. 
         
         This schema is designed following a "Venetian Blind" design pattern. 
         This means that each element type is defined separately and a separate
         element declaration is created. This pattern maximizes the reusability
         of the schema. 
         
         ** Overriding Principles ** 
         
           * The general derivation hierarchy is from most abstract to most 
             concrete.
           * Terminology chosen for abstract elements is purposefully designed
             to minimize conflict with existing terminology by avoiding well-
             established terms. 
           * Terminology chosen for concrete elements is purposefully designed 
             to map very closely to existing terminology. 
           * The overall tag set is kept as small as possible without
             compromising semantic richness. 
           * The schema is more permissive than is absolutely necessary. As this
             schema must support legacy documents, a looser rather than tighter
             contract is required to be enforced by the schema. In general, the
             abstract layer is intended to support the variation extremes while
             the concrete layer is intended to support modern practices. 
           * Consistency with XHTML naming conventions and practices is 
             maximized. 
           * Care has been taken to avoid reinventing mark-up for areas, such as
             tables or formulas, where other good mark-up has already been
             designed. 
           * The overall structure has been designed to create a readable 
             document without any unnecessary redirection. 
           * All text shown in the printed or published document is regular 
             text, not contained within attributes or to be generated from 
             attribute data. Rather, the resulting text is shown in the content. 
           * Attributes are used to contain metadata or normalized forms of 
             text content. (i.e. normalized numeric values) The general flow of
             data is from the content to the attributes rather than the other
             way around.
           * The schema is designed for editing documents as well as for complete  
             documents. This means that the "empty document" situation is handled
             and validates as a complete and correct document. 
             
         ** General Definitions **
         
         Jurisdictions:
           * United States Federal Government - us
           
         Languages:
           * English Language - eng
         
         ** Primitives **
         
         The purpose of the primitives is to provide the fundamental building
         blocks out of which everything can be built. The primitives are a 
         minimal set of basic type definitions along with a corresponding set
         of element declarations. 
         
         At the very top of the derivation tree is the "BaseType" and two 
         closely related derivatives "BaseBlockType" and "BaseContentType". These
         types are primarily to provide base types for all the attributes. They
         are defined as abstract types and therefore cannot be instantiated. 
         
         All other types derive from these types, by way of either restriction
         and/or extension. The terminology chosen for the primitive layer has 
         been selected to describe, in the most general of terms, the fundamental
         building blocks. Care has been taken to avoid using terms which already
         have an established meaning within U.S. legislation and to avoid implying
         too much meaning or structure beyond the primitive nature of the 
         elements. 
         
         ** Common Core ** 
         
         The common core defines the basic structure of a legislative document.
         It is a very abstract and general model intended to be flexible enough
         to handle the widest variations likely to be encountered.
         
         It is possible, using the common core, along with the primitives defined
         above and the generics defined below, to model any U.S legislation,
         albeit abstractly. The terminology chosen has been selected to be 
         familiar without conflicting with any well-established meanings in use
         for U.S. legislation. 
         
         ** Structural Building Blocks **
         
         The structural building blocks are assemblies of elements which are
         used to define the common core. Rather than defining individual elements, 
         they define groups of elements which are placed together to define
         the content of elements in the common core. The building blocks are
         largely responsible for taking care of the flexible notes model and
         the underlying versioning model. 
         
         ** Generics ** 
         
         The generics provide fundamental elements necessary to model any 
         type of document. These elements fit within the common core, but are
         not themselves a part of it. In general, these elements model common
         structures like paragraphs, images, columns, and line breaks.
         
         The generics exist to complete the common core without clouding the
         core with basic functions that don't contribute the legislative nature
         of the schema. The terminology chosen has been selected to be familiar
         everyday terms for common concepts. Care has been taken to not 
         override any well-established meaning in use for U.S. legislation. 
         
         ** Synonyms **
         
         The synonyms are used to give familiar and comfortable terms to the
         most commonly used elements in modern legislation. These synonyms are
         more meaningful tags used as equivalent substitutes for the more
         abstract tags defined in the common core. As they are defined as
         synonyms rather than within a rigid content model, care must be taken
         to avoid using them in ways beyond their original intent and harming
         the semantic value of XML. 
         
         ** Naming Elements **
         
         There are three attributes for defining names for elements. Each of
         these attributes may or may not be used in all situations:
         
          * The @id attribute is an immutable identity, one that is not changed
            once it is assigned. Therefore, it should not reflect any aspect of
            the element that is subject to change, such as an assigned number.
            The preferred algorithm for generating the @id attribute value is to
            use a GUID (Globally Unique IDentifier) generator that guarantees
            uniqueness in all space and time. The @id should be given a simple "id"
            prefix.
            
          * The @identifier attribute specifies the URL context and identity of 
            the element. Typically, the @identifier will be established on the
            root element or on any element, such as a <quotedContent> or
            <quotedText> element, that changes the context.        
             
          * The @temporalId attribute is assigned a changeable, human-meaningful,
            identifier. Like the @name attribute, the @temporalId will vary with
            time. For this reason, the @temporalId is computed each time a document
            is extracted from the repository, based on the point-in-time requested,
            rather than being statically stored with the text in the repository. The
            @temporalId is specified to be nominally unique within the document to which
            the element belongs. The @temporalId is composed by concatenating the 
            @temporalId of the element's parent, if existing (or the parent element's
            name if the @temporalId does not exist), "_", and the element's <num> 
            @value. For example, paragraph 2 of subsection (a) of section 1 should
            have the @temporalId of "s1_a_2".
          
         ** Referencing Model **
         
         All references are modeled as relative URLs. References are made to 
         a logical rather than a physical hierarchy that starts always from the
         jurisdiction and reaches down to individual provisions within a bill,
         resolution, or other Legislation. References do not predict or expect
         any particular document partitioning. It is the intent of the URL handler
         to map the logical hierarchy to any specific physical hierarchy.
         
         The highest level of the hierarchy is always the jurisdiction code,
         specified using the ISO 3166-1 country code and optionally followed by
         a dash and a lower level jurisdiction code. For the U.S. Federal
         Government, the jurisdiction code is "us".
         
         Lower levels of the hierarchy should use an abbreviated prefix or a numeric/
         alphabetic entry to identify the target. Each level in the reference is 
         separated with the "/" in a hierarchy. For instance, Title 5 is expressed
         as "/us/usc/t5" while Pub. L. 111-314 is expressed as "/us/pl/111/314".
         
         When a URL is extended to within a document, the document hierarchy is
         expressed in an abbreviated form as in "/us/usc/t5/s101" or 
         "/us/pl/111/314/s1". To build this URL, append the reference to the
         document with "/" + the level designators. So a reference to "title 2 of
         division 3 of public law 113-314" would be "/us/pl/111/314/d3/t2".
         
         A language-neutral reference does not include a language code. To 
         create a reference to a specific language version of the document,
         include a language identifier at the nominal document level following
         a "!" symbol. For instance, to specify a reference to
         section 101 the English version of title 51, the
         reference would be "/us/usc/t51!eng/s101". 
         
         To make a reference to a version that is operational at a specific
         point in time, include a date specification at the nominal document
         level following a "@" symbol ("at" the time of). For instance, to 
         specify a reference to section 101 of Title 51 on 1 February, 
         2013, the reference would be "/us/usc/t51@2013-02-01/s101". 
         
         When including both a language and a time specification, place
         the language specification ahead of the time specification. For 
         instance to combine both examples above, the result would be
         "/us/usc/t51!eng@2013-02-01/s101".

            The status enumeration is used to specify the state of a provision 
            during the period of time defined by the @startPeriod and the
            @endPeriod attributes attached to the same element or hierarchically
            defined above.

            Typically, the status enumeration is applied to the <section> level
            or lower, but the model is general enough that it can be applied
            anywhere in the level hierarchy.

               The @id attribute should always be assigned an immutable 
               (non-changing) value. If the item is subject to renaming or 
               renumbering, then the @id attribute should not reflect any part 
               of the changeable part. This is to allow the @id to be long 
               lasting without causing confusion should the item be renamed or 
               renumbered. 
               
               The @id should be prefixed with "id" and followed by a GUID that
               is guaranteed to be globally unique across both time and space.
               
               As an "xsd:ID", the identity must be ensured to be unique in the
               document - and it is a good idea that it be guaranteed globally 
               unique. As the @id is immutable, it is a good identity with which
               to associate external information to the item.
               
               If an item is deleted and later a similarly named item is 
               created, then the new item should be assigned a newly generated 
               identity as it is not the same item as the earlier item.
               
               The @id attribute is optional, but recommended for all elements

               according to the temporal specification in a requesting URL.
               
               A @temporalId is intended to be scoped to the document as a whole
               while the @name is scoped to its immediate parent. The 
               @temporalId is built as an "_" separated hierarchy of @name
               or, in the absence of an @name, element names. However, in a 
               couple cases, the levels of the hierarchy are suppressed. First
               of all, the <main> level is suppressed when calculating any
               @temporalId contained within. Secondly, when dealing with 
               sections which are numbered as a sequence without regard to
               the upper levels, then the upper levels are suppressed from the
               computation of the @temporalId.
               
               Some examples:
               
                * "s2" - section 2 in the main part of the document
                * "schedule_s2" - section 2 in the schedule
                * "pt2_d1" - division 1 of part 2 in the main part of the 
                  document
               
               The @temporalId attribute is optional.

               Use the @role attribute to provide further refinement to an
               element's type. This is particularly useful when defining a
               refinement of an element from the abstract set. Another possible 
               use is to use the customary local name for an element whenever
               the element name is not a complete match. For example, if the 
               customary name for an "explanation" is "summary", then the 
               element can be expressed as <explanation role="summary">.
               
               There is a rough equivalence between an element of a base class
               with a @role attribute and a derived class in the schema, although
               this equivalence is not explicit. For example 
               <level role="division"> is roughly equal to <division>.
               
               When transforming XML to HTML, the @role attribute should be 
               appended to the element name using an "_" underscore and used
               as the first value in the HTML @class attribute. If desired,
               the proposed XHTML @role attribute can be computed as either the
               XML @role attribute or, in the absence of the XML @role 
               attribute, the XML element name. For example:
               
               <level role="division">
                  => <div role="division" class="level_division"> 
               
               <division> 
                  => <div role="division" class="division">
                  
               This approach is easily reversible.

         <![CDATA[         

         ** Primitive Definitions **
         
         There are five basic primitive types. All elements are defined to be
         one of these five basic types. In addition to types derived from these
         five basic types, there are also five abstract element declared 
         directly from these types. These elements can be used, in some cases, 
         for when the more specific cases do not apply. In those cases, the 
         primitive types can be used along with the @role attribute to create 
         new informal types.
         
         *** Basic Rules ***
         
           * A marker contains nothing within it.   
           * An inline contains text, or any inline structure including 
             inline, ref, or marker.
           * A block contains any block structure including block, content, 
             or property.
           * A content (block) contains text or any block or other content.

            The property core type is used to record metadata about a document.
            Properties usually are found in the meta or preface area of the 
            document. Properties can also be found in the text of the document
            if they are allowed, expressly or by substitution group. The text
            content of a property other than in the meta section is the official 
            text in the document and a normalized date, value, or reference 
            attribute might also be defined.
            
            In some cases, specific elements are derived from the property type
            with more descriptive names. In that case, the descriptive name is
            the equivalent of the @name attribute on a core property element.

            The level core type is the basic element in the primary document
            hierarchy. Levels are used to represent items ranging from Title,
            Subtitle, etc, down to subsubclauses. Typically, a derived synonym 
            which more closely describes the level type will be used rather 
            than the abstract.
            
            There are some level types found in U.S. Code which
            do not have a defined name or number.  For example, see the
            undesignated heading levels in Title 12, Chapter 7.
