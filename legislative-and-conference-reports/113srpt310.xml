        <recommendation> The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to which was referred the bill (S. 1014) to reduce sports-related 
            concussions in youth, and for other purposes, having considered the same, reports favorably thereon with an amendment (in the 
            nature of a substitute) and recommends that the bill (as amended) do pass.</recommendation>
        <segment role="purpose">
            <heading class="smallCaps">Purpose of the Bill</heading>
            <p>In recent years, a constant drumbeat of press coverage about the long-term implications of traumatic brain injury 
            among athletes has caused widespread alarm among parents and growing public awareness of its dangers. Yet this public 
            concern has also resulted in the proliferation of unfair and deceptive safety claims to sell protective sports equipment and 
            has highlighted the need to streamline the FTC's authority over these claims, as well as a closer review of safety standards 
            for sports equipment.</p>
            <p>On October 19, 2011, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate held a hearing, <i>Concussions 
                    and the Marketing of Sports Equipment</i>, which examined its investigative findings of widespread usage of “anti-concussion,” “concussion-reducing,” or other unfounded claims in the marketing of sports equipment. In August 2012, 
            the FTC brought an enforcement action against the makers of Brain-Pad mouth guards for false and misleading claims. Still, 
            products touting unfounded promises of concussion “prevention” continue to be readily available online.</p>
            <p>While much of the media coverage has centered on the tragedies of former NFL players with histories of brain 
            injuries, doctors say that young athletes are more vulnerable to concussions and face greater negative consequences. This 
            past school year, more than 300,000 high school athletes were diagnosed with concussions. And since 2005, over 1.3 million 
            concussions have been diagnosed among high school athletes in just the top 9 most popular sports. These figures, researchers 
            say, likely understate - vastly - the true extent of the epidemic because many head injuries go unreported or ignored.
            In October 2013, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies issued a report, Sports-Related Concussions in Youth: 
            Improving the Science, Changing the Culture, which is referenced in the legislation and was commissioned at the 
            urging of Chairman John D. Rockefeller IV and Senator Tom Udall. The report found that much remains unknown about the 
            extent of concussions in youth, but it found limited evidence that current helmet designs reduce the risk of sport-related 
            concussions and no evidence that mouth guards or other facial protection equipment reduce concussion risk. The Institute of 
            Medicine's report recommended that the Federal Government invest in additional research into biomechanical factors that 
            influence injury risk in youth and that this data be used to inform the development of effective protective equipment safety 
            standards.</p>

            <heading class="smallCaps">Summary of Provisions</heading>
            <p>S. 1014 would allow the FTC to clarify what constitutes an 
            unfair and deceptive act or practice in regards to safety 
            claims involving sports equipment, and it would provide the FTC 
            the authority to impose civil penalties for such violations. 
            The legislation would also provide State attorneys general the 
            authority to enforce such advertising violations.
            The bill has received support from numerous sports, 
            medical, and consumer organizations: American Academy of 
            Neurology, American Academy of Pediatrics, Brain Injury 
            Association of America, Brain Trauma Foundation, Cleveland 
            Clinic, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Major 
            League Baseball, Major League Baseball Players Association, 
            Major League Soccer, Major League Soccer Players Union, 
            National Association of State Head Injury Administrators, 
            National Athletic Trainers’ Association, National Basketball 
            Association, National Collegiate Athletic Association, National 
            Consumers League, National Federation of State High School 
            Associations, National Football League, National Football 
            League Players Association, National Hockey League, National 
            Interscholastic Athletic Administrators Association, National 
            Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment, Safe 
            Kids Worldwide, US Lacrosse, U.S. Soccer Federation, and USA

            <heading class="smallCaps">Legislative History</heading>
            <p>On April 9, 2014, in an open Executive Session, the 
                Committee considered the bill and reported S. 1014, as amended, 
                favorably by voice vote. The Committee adopted a substitute 
                amendment from Senator Rockefeller.</p>
        </segment>
        <estimatedCosts>
            <heading class="smallCaps">Estimated Costs</heading>
          <p>  In accordance with paragraph 11(a) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate and section 403 of the 
            Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Committee provides the following cost estimate, prepared by the Congressional Budget 
            Office:</p>
           <subheading class="italic"> S. 1014—Youth Sports Concussion Act</subheading>
            <p>S. 1014 would prohibit importers and sellers of athletic equipment from making deceptive claims about the safety of that 
            equipment. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would be directed to write regulations to enforce the new prohibition.</p>
            <p>Based on information from the FTC, CBO estimates that the cost of implementing S. 1014 would not be significant because 
            the agency is already taking action to enforce such a prohibition under its general authority. Enacting S. 1014 would 
            not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.</p>
            <p>S. 1014 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.</p>
            <p>The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Susan Willie. 
            The estimate was approved by Theresa Gullo, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.</p>

            <subheading class="smallCaps">economic impact</subheading>

            <p>In compliance with paragraph 4(b) of rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee provides that no 
                provisions contained in the bill, as reported, meet the definition of congressionally directed spending items under the 
                rule.</p>

        <segment><heading class="smallCaps">Section-by-Section Analysis</heading>
    <subheading class="smallCaps">Section 1. Short title.</subheading>
    <p>Section 1 of the bill would establish the short title of the bill as the “Youth Sports Concussion Act.”</p>
    <subheading class="smallCaps">Section 2. Sense of Congress.</subheading>
    <p>Section 2 of the bill would provide the sense of Congress that scientific advancements and a greater understanding 
        of the issues that affect the health and safety of young athletes are key to reducing sports-related concussions in youth. 
        The sense of Congress would call on the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the FTC to review the October 2013 report from 
    the Institute of Medicine to inform their efforts to protect consumers. It also urges that any voluntary standards adopted 
    by protective sports equipment manufacturers include a mechanism to ensure substantial compliance.
    </p>
    <subheading class="smallCaps">Section 3. False or misleading claims with respect to athletic sporting activity equipment.</subheading>
    <p>Section 3 of the bill would make it unlawful for any person 
    to sell, offer for sale, or import any item or equipment for 
    which the seller or importer, or anyone on their behalf, makes 
    any deceptive claim about the safety benefits of the item or 
    equipment. Any such violation would be considered a violation 
    of a rule under section 18 of the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. 57a). 
    Should the FTC believe that a rulemaking is needed to carry out 
    this section, the FTC would be empowered to do so under section 
    553 of title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the 
    Administrative Procedure Act). Section 3 of the bill also would 
    authorize State attorneys general to bring actions against 
    entities that are in violation of this section, subject to 
    intervention by the FTC.</p>
