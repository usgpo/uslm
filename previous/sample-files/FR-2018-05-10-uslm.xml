Generally, the APA requires that an agency provide prior notice and opportunity for public comment before issuing a final rule. The APA provides exceptions to its notice and public comment procedures when an agency finds there is good cause for dispensing with such procedures because they are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We find that there is good cause under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)</ref> to issue this regulatory change as a final rule without prior public comment. We find that prior public comment is unnecessary because this final rule only removes from the Code of Federal Regulations obsolete and unnecessary rules that do not affect any living beneficiaries.

For the reasons stated above, we find it unnecessary to delay the effective date of the changes we are making in this final rule. Accordingly, we are making them effective upon publication.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This rule makes a technical correction to the regulations that govern Direct Federal Acquisition to correct a misplaced word in the first sentence of <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/s710.603/a">23 CFR 710.603(a)</ref>. The preamble to the Final Rule (<ref href="/us/fr/81/57716">81 FR 57716</ref>, <date date="2016-08-23">August 23, 2016</date>) discusses this sentence and makes clear that no changes would be made to the sentence proposed in the NPRM (<ref href="/us/fr/79/69998">79 FR 69998</ref>, <date date="2014-11-24">November 24, 2014</date>). However, the regulatory text adopted switches the order of the words in the sentence. This action corrects the regulatory text to reduce confusion and reflect the Agency's intended language. Specifically, the word “not” is relocated so that the current relevant portion of language is changed from “[t]he provisions of this paragraph may not be applied to any real property that is owned by the United States” to read “[t]he provisions of this paragraph may be applied to any real property that is not owned by the United States.”

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under the Administrative Procedure Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b">5 U.S.C. 553(b)</ref>), an agency may waive the normal notice and comment requirements if it finds, for good cause, that they are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. The FHWA finds that notice and comment for this rule is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest because it will have no substantive impact, is technical in nature, and relates only to management, organization, procedure, and practice. The FHWA does not anticipate receiving meaningful comments on it. States, local governments, and their consultants rely upon the regulations corrected by this action. This correction will reduce confusion for these entities and should not be unnecessarily delayed. Accordingly, for the reasons listed above, the agencies find good cause under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/3/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B)</ref> to waive notice and opportunity for comment.

It is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal. This rule only entails a minor correction that will not in any way alter the regulatory effect of <ref href="/us/cfr/t23/p710">23 CFR part 710</ref>. Thus, this final rule will not adversely affect, in a material way, any sector of the economy. In addition, these changes will not interfere with any action taken or planned by another agency and will not materially alter the budgetary impact of any entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs. This action complies with E.O.s 12866, 13563, and 13771 to improve regulation. <?page num="21710"?>The FHWA considers this proposed rule to be an <ref href="/us/eo/13771">E.O. 13771</ref> deregulatory action because it is intended to reduce confusion and reflect the Agency's intended language.

This final rule will not make any substantive changes to our regulations or in the way that our regulations affect small entities; it merely corrects technical errors. For this reason, FHWA certifies that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The California Department of Transportation has requested a temporary change to the operation of the Tower Drawbridge over the Sacramento River, mile 59.0, at Sacramento, CA. The drawbridge navigation span provides a vertical clearance of 30 feet above Mean High Water in the closed-to-navigation position. The draw operates as required by <ref href="/us/cfr/t33/s117.189/a">33 CFR 117.189(a)</ref>. Navigation on the waterway is commercial and recreational.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The drawspan will be secured in the closed-to-navigation position from 10 a.m. through 10:30 a.m. and from 1 p.m. through 2 p.m. on <date date="2018-05-19">May 19, 2018</date>, to allow the participants from the AMGEN Tour of California to cross the drawspan safely and without interruption. This temporary deviation has been coordinated with the waterway users. No objections to the proposed temporary deviation were raised. Vessels able to pass through the bridge in the closed position may do so at any time. In the event of an emergency, the draw can open on signal if at least one-hour notice is given to the bridge operator. There are no immediate alternate routes for vessels to pass. The Coast Guard will also inform the users of the waterway through our Local and Broadcast Notices to Mariners of the change in operating schedule for the bridge so that vessel operators can arrange their transits to minimize any impact caused by the temporary deviation.
</p>

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The California Department of Transportation has requested a temporary change to the operation of the Isleton Drawbridge, mile 18.7, over the Sacramento River, at Isleton, CA. The drawbridge navigation span provides a vertical clearance of 15 feet above Mean High Water in the closed-to-navigation position. The draw operates as required by <ref href="/us/cfr/t33/s117.189/a">33 CFR 117.189(a)</ref>. Navigation on the waterway is commercial and recreational.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The drawspan will be secured in the closed-to-navigation position from 12 p.m. through 1 p.m. on <date date="2018-05-17">May 17, 2018</date>, to allow the participants from the AMGEN Tour of California to cross the drawspan safely and without interruption. This temporary deviation has been coordinated with the waterway users. No objections to the proposed temporary deviation were raised.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Vessels able to pass through the bridge in the closed position may do so at anytime. The bridge will be able to open for emergencies and there is no immediate alternate route for vessels to pass. The Coast Guard will also inform the users of the waterway through our Local and Broadcast Notices to Mariners of the change in operating schedule for the bridge so that vessel operators can arrange their transits to minimize any impact caused by the temporary deviation.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In accordance with <ref href="/us/cfr/t33/s117.35/e">33 CFR 117.35(e)</ref>, the drawbridge must return to its regular operating schedule immediately at the end of the effective period of this temporary deviation.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2018-05-03">May 3, 2018</date>, Bechtel notified the Coast Guard that a cargo movement in the vicinity of the Vanport Highway Bridge could create potential hazards for the bridge's structural integrity. The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b">5 U.S.C. 553(b)</ref>). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/3/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B)</ref>, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because it is impracticable. We did not receive notice of this cargo operation until <date date="2018-05-03">May 3, 2018</date>. This safety zone must be established by <date date="2018-05-06">May 6, 2018</date>, and we lack sufficient time to provide a reasonable comment period and then consider those comments before issuing this rule. The NPRM process would delay the establishment of the safety zone until after the date of the cargo operation and compromise public safety.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/d/3">5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)</ref>, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>. Delaying the effective date of this rule would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest because immediate action is needed to protect the public and vessels from the potential safety hazards associated with the cargo movement operation.

The Captain of the Port Marine Safety Unit Pittsburgh (COTP) has determined that potential hazards associated with a cargo movement operation that will take place during the week of <date date="2018-05-06">May 6, 2018</date> will be a safety concern for anyone within a half-mile stretch of the Ohio River. This rule is necessary to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment in the navigable waters before, during, and after the cargo movement.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This rule establishes a safety zone from 8 a.m. on <date date="2018-05-06">May 6, 2018</date> through 6 p.m. on <date date="2018-05-11">May 11, 2018</date> for all navigable waters of the Ohio River from mile marker 27.8 to mile marker 28.2. Entry into this safety zone during the enforcement period is prohibited, unless authorized by the COTP or a designated representative. Subject to the cargo delivery intervals and potential inclement weather, the period of <?page num="21713"?>enforcement will be 30 minutes prior to, during, and 1 hour after any cargo movement near the Vanport Highway Bridge. The Coast Guard was informed that the operation would take place during daylight hours only and last approximately 4 hours. A safety vessel will coordinate all vessel traffic during the enforcement period. The COTP or a designated representative will inform the public through Broadcast Notice to Mariners (BNM), Local Notices to Mariners (LNM), and/or Marine Safety Information Broadcasts (MSIBs), or through other means of public notice as appropriate at least 3 hours in advance of the enforcement period. The duration of the zone is intended to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment in these navigable waters during cargo movement operations. No vessel or person will be permitted to enter the safety zone without obtaining permission from the COTP or a designated representative. A designated representative is a commissioned, warrant, or petty officer of the U.S. Coast Guard assigned to units under the operational control of Marine Safety Unit Pittsburgh. They may be contacted on VHF–FM Channel 16 or 67. Persons and vessels permitted to enter this regulated area must transit at their slowest safe speed and comply with all lawful directions issued by the COTP or the designated representative.

This rule has not been designated a “significant regulatory action,” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>. Accordingly, this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and pursuant to OMB guidance it is exempt from the requirements of <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref>.








 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This regulatory action determination is based on the size, location, duration, and time-of-year of the safety zone. This safety zone will be enforced for a period of four hours on one day on less than a half mile of the Ohio River. The Coast Guard will issue Local Notice to Mariners and Broadcast Notice to Mariners via VHF–FM marine channel 16 about the temporary safety zone. This rule also allows vessels to seek permission from the COTP or a designated representative to enter the safety zone.

The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s605/b">5 U.S.C. 605(b)</ref> that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1–888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734–3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.

Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.

This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)</ref>, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because doing so would be impracticable. The Coast Guard did not receive the final details of this fireworks display in time to publish an NPRM. As such, it is impracticable to publish an NPRM because we lack sufficient time to provide a reasonable comment period and then consider those comments before issuing the rule.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits. <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref> directs agencies to control regulatory costs through a budgeting process. This rule has not been designated a “significant regulatory action,” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>. Accordingly, this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and pursuant to OMB guidance it is exempt from the requirements of <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This regulatory action determination is based on the size, location, duration, and time-of-year of the safety zone. Vessel traffic will be able to safely transit around this safety zone which will impact a small designated area of Lake St. Clair from 10 p.m. on <date date="2018-06-30">June 30, 2018</date> through 11 p.m. on <date date="2018-07-01">July 1, 2018</date>. Moreover, the Coast Guard will issue Broadcast Notice to Mariners (BNM) via VHF–FM marine channel 16 about the zone and the rule allows vessels to seek permission to enter the zone.

The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s605/b">5 U.S.C. 605(b)</ref> that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (<ref href="/us/pl/104/121">Pub.

The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1–888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734–3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.

In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.

The duration of this safety zone is extended through <date date="2018-06-15">June 15, 2018</date>. This safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from the hazards associated with installing the navigation span and will restrict vessel traffic from the bridge's navigation span as it is under construction by preventing vessel traffic on a portion of Oregon Inlet. Entry of vessels or persons into this safety zone is prohibited.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2017-10-10">October 10, 2017</date>, the North Carolina Department of Transportation notified the Coast Guard that they <?page num="21718"?>would be installing the navigation span of the new Herbert C. Bonner Bridge in Oregon Inlet, Dare County, North Carolina on January 29 through <date date="2018-03-24">March 24, 2018</date>, with alternate dates of March 25 through <date date="2018-05-06">May 6, 2018</date>. In response, following publication of an NPRM and solicitation of public comments, on <date date="2018-01-01">January 1, 2018</date>, the Coast Guard published a final rule establishing a temporary safety zone effective from <date date="2018-01-29">January 29, 2018</date> through <date date="2018-03-24">March 24, 2018</date>, <ref href="/us/fr/83/2910">83 FR 2910</ref> with alternate dates of <date date="2018-03-25">March 25, 2018</date> through <date date="2018-05-06">May 6, 2018</date>. Due to inclement weather and material delays the project has been delayed and the project completion date has been extended through <date date="2018-06-15">June 15, 2018</date>. The COTP North Carolina has determined that potential safety hazards associated with the construction will be a concern for anyone transiting the Oregon Inlet navigation channel.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary rule to re-establish and extend the duration of the temporary safety zone without prior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b">5 U.S.C. 553(b)</ref>). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)</ref>, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because notification of the need to extend the safety zone was not given to the Coast Guard until <date date="2018-04-26">April 26, 2018</date>. It is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to publish an NPRM because we must extend the safety zone immediately through <date date="2018-06-15">June 15, 2018</date>, to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment on the navigable waters in Oregon Inlet during this construction phase.

Delaying the effective date of this rule would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest because immediate action is needed to protect persons, vessels, and the marine environment on the navigable waters in Oregon Inlet during this construction phase.

Construction is expected to take place on 33 separate days during this construction period. The safety zone will be active for two hours each day, with the exact times announced via Broadcast Notices to Mariners at least 48 hours prior to enforcement. The safety zone will include all navigable waters of Oregon Inlet from approximate position 35°46′23″ N, 75°32′18″ W, thence southeast to 35°46′18″ N, 75°32′12″ W, thence southwest to 35°46′16″ N, 75°32′16″ W, thence northwest to 35°46′20″ N, 75°32′23″ W, thence northeast back to the point of origin, (NAD 1983). This zone is intended to protect persons, vessels, and the marine environment on the navigable waters in Oregon Inlet during this construction phase. No vessel or person will be permitted to enter the safety zone during the designated times.

This rule has not been designated a “significant regulatory action,” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>. Accordingly, this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and pursuant to OMB guidance it is exempt from the requirements of <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref>.

Vessel traffic will not be allowed to enter or transit a portion of Oregon Inlet during specific two hour periods on 33 separate days from January 29 through <date date="2018-06-15">June 15, 2018</date>. The specific two hour period for each work day will be broadcasted at least 48 hours in advance and vessels will be able to transit Oregon Inlet at all other times. The Coast Guard will issue a Local Notice to Mariners and transmit a Broadcast Notice to Mariners via VHF–FM marine channel 16 regarding the safety zone. This portion of Oregon Inlet has been determined to be a medium to low traffic area at this time of the year. This rule does not allow vessels to request permission to enter the safety zone covering a portion of the Oregon Inlet navigation channel during the designated times.</p>

The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard received no comments from the Small Business Administration on this rulemaking. The Coast Guard certifies under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s605/b">5 U.S.C. 605(b)</ref> that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Ohio submitted infrastructure SIPs for the following NAAQS: 2006 24-hour PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> (September 4, 2009); 2012 annual PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> (December 4, 2015); 2010 NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> (February 8 and 25, 2013); 2010 SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> (June 7, 2013); and 2008 ozone (December 27, 2012), which relied on the State having a fully approved regional haze SIP to satisfy its prong 4 requirements. However, EPA had not fully approved Ohio's regional haze SIP, as the Agency issued a limited disapproval of the State's original regional haze plan on <date date="2012-06-07">June 7, 2012</date>, due to the plan's reliance on CAIR. To correct the deficiencies in its regional haze SIP and obtain approval of the aforementioned infrastructure SIPs that rely on the regional haze SIP, the State submitted a SIP revision on <date date="2016-11-30">November 30, 2016</date>, to replace reliance on CAIR with reliance on CSAPR.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Ohio has corrected the deficiencies that led to EPA's limited approval/limited disapproval of the State's regional haze SIP. Accordingly, EPA is approving the regional haze portion of the State's <date date="2016-11-30">November 30, 2016</date> SIP revision and converting EPA's previous action on Ohio's regional haze SIP from a limited approval/limited disapproval to a full approval. Specifically, EPA finds that this portion of Ohio's <date date="2016-11-30">November 30, 2016</date>, SIP revision satisfies the SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> and NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline> BART requirements and SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> reasonable progress requirements for EGUs formerly subject to CAIR. With the approval of Ohio's regional haze SIP revision, the State's SIP now provides for the measures needed to ensure that its emissions do not interfere with measures required to be included in other states' plans to protect visibility. Therefore, EPA is also approving the prong 4 portion of Ohio's 2006 24-hour PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> submission, 2012 annual PM<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2.5</inline> submission, 2010 NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> submissions, and 2010 SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> submission; as well as converting EPA's disapproval of the prong 4 portions of Ohio's 2008 ozone infrastructure submission to an approval. On <date date="2017-09-29">September 29, 2017</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/82/45481">82 FR 45481</ref>), EPA published a final rule affirming the continued validity of the Agency's 2012 determination that participation in CSAPR meets the Regional Haze Rule's criteria for an alternative to the application of source specific BART. In line with this affirmation, EPA is approving Ohio's regional haze and prong 4 submissions described above.

This Second Report and Order (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Order</inline>) adopts a new rule requiring “covered providers”—entities that select the initial long-distance route for a large number of lines—to monitor the performance of the “intermediate providers” to which they hand off calls. The <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Order</inline> also eliminates the call completion reporting requirement for covered providers that was established by the Commission in 2013.

</heading>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">1. Monitoring Requirement
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">1. The record in this proceeding and our complaint data establish that rural call completion issues persist. Covered providers have incentives both to serve customers well and minimize routing costs; but these incentives are in tension because least-cost routing can lead to poor call completion performance. While intercarrier compensation reform has the potential to greatly improve rural call completion, it is unlikely to eliminate all incentives that may lead to call completion issues in the foreseeable future. We are committed to refining our approach to better target these important issues.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">2. Building on our proposal in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">RCC 2nd FNPRM,</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/82/34911">82 FR 34911</ref>, we specifically require that for each intermediate provider with which it contracts, a covered provider shall: (a) Monitor the intermediate provider's performance in the completion of call attempts to rural telephone companies from subscriber lines for which the covered provider makes the initial long-distance call path choice; and (b) based on the results of such monitoring, take steps that are reasonably calculated to correct any identified performance problem with the intermediate provider, including removing the intermediate provider from a particular route after sustained inadequate performance. We revise subsection (b) of the rule from our proposal in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">RCC 2nd FNPRM</inline> to direct covered providers to correct performance problems, rather than hold intermediate providers accountable. To be clear, taking steps that are reasonably calculated to correct any identified performance problem with the intermediate provider often will involve holding the intermediate provider accountable for its performance. Nevertheless, we find this change to the rule text warranted to focus subsection (b) directly on resolving rural call completion problems, rather than a particular means for doing so. Additionally, the RCC Act gives us authority to hold intermediate providers accountable for meeting service quality standards, so specifically directing covered providers to hold intermediate providers accountable is less beneficial than prior to the RCC Act's enactment. We include the phrase “take steps that <?page num="21724"?>are reasonably calculated to” and the word “identified” consistent with our conclusion that we do not impose strict liability on covered providers. As explained in detail below, the monitoring requirement we adopt entails both <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">prospective</inline> evaluation to prevent problems and <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">retrospective</inline> investigation of any problems that arise. We also require covered providers to take steps that are reasonably calculated to correct any identified performance problem with the intermediate provider.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">3. The monitoring requirement we adopt has significant support in the record. It encourages covered providers to ensure that calls are completed, assigns clear responsibility for call completion issues, and enhances our ability to take enforcement action. We therefore reject arguments that Commission action is unnecessary. We anticipate that the monitoring rule we adopt will ensure better call completion to rural areas by covered providers. We recognize that as a hypothetical alternative means to increase the incentive for good rural call completion performance, we could instead increase the size of penalties for violations of the Act and our rules stemming from rural call completion failures. We nonetheless find the monitoring rule we adopt necessary for several reasons. Today's <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Order</inline> details appropriate action required of covered providers to serve this goal and adopts improved substantive measures, such as requiring prospective monitoring and disclosure of contact information. As these new measures will serve our goal to improve rural call completion, they should reduce the necessity for enforcement action, and aid our enforcement efforts when needed. Although the existence of statutory penalties may encourage compliance with the law, they should not supplant our efforts to facilitate compliance in the first instance. While sections 201 and 202 of the Act provide important support for our rural call completion efforts, establishing a new rule with more detailed guidelines will enhance our ability to take enforcement action and provide additional certainty to covered providers regarding the actions they must take. Call completion problems persist as to both traditional telephony and VoIP. Therefore, we reject VON's argument that we should continue to allow VoIP providers to self-regulate. The passage of the RCC Act does not obviate the need for covered provider regulation, contrary to ITTA's contention. In the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Further Notice</inline> accompanying this <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Order,</inline> we seek comment on whether to change the monitoring requirements in light of the service quality standards for intermediate providers under consideration, for instance by creating a safe harbor for covered providers who work with intermediate providers that meet our quality standards. While we expect that implementing the RCC Act will lead to improved intermediate provider performance, we nonetheless agree with commenters who assert that covered providers have a responsibility to monitor intermediate provider performance. The record makes clear that it is important to hold a central party responsible for call completion issues. Given that covered providers select the initial long-distance path and therefore can choose how to route a call, we find it appropriate that they should have responsibility for monitoring rural call completion performance. Further, a covered provider that originates a call is easier to identify than an intermediate provider in a potentially lengthy and complicated call path, facilitating enforcement where needed.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">4. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Prospective Monitoring.</inline> As part of fulfilling the monitoring requirement, covered providers have a duty to prospectively evaluate intermediate providers to prevent reasonably foreseeable problems. We agree with NASUCA that after-the-fact remediation without other preventative actions is insufficient to prevent call completion problems from occurring. Required prospective monitoring includes regular observation of intermediate provider performance and call routing decision-making; periodic evaluation to determine whether to make changes to improve rural call completion performance; and actions to promote improved call completion performance where warranted. To ensure consistent prospective monitoring and facilitate Commission oversight, we expect covered providers to document their processes for prospective monitoring and identify staff responsible for such monitoring functions in the written documentation, and we expect covered providers to comply with that written documentation in conducting the required prospective monitoring.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">5. We agree with numerous commenters that covered providers must have flexibility in determining and conducting prospective monitoring that is appropriate for their respective networks and mixes of traffic. Covered providers have unique “network-specific demands and customer expectations” and we agree that “a one-size-fits-all implementation” could unduly limit their ability to meet those demands and expectations. We therefore provide covered providers the flexibility to determine the standards and methods best suited to their individual networks. We agree with Comcast that regardless of how a covered provider engages in monitoring, its approach must involve comparing rural and non-rural areas to ensure that Americans living in rural areas are receiving adequate service. Covered providers may make this comparison based on any measures reasonably calculated to evaluate call completion efficacy. Such measures may include metrics such as call answer rate, call completion rate, or network effectiveness ratio; or evaluating the implementation of specific measures to ensure adequate performance that build on those we propose to require intermediate providers to meet to comply with the service quality standards required under the RCC Act. Verizon's consent decree provides negative traffic spikes as one internal investigation trigger. The Verizon rural call completion study, commissioned pursuant to this consent decree, explains that a negative spike is a “sharp decrease from prior measurements over a short time.” We encourage covered providers to consider this and other possible metrics for use in fulfilling the monitoring requirement. Although we do not believe that it should be unduly difficult for covered providers to evaluate and compare how their intermediate providers perform in delivering traffic to individual rural OCNs, we also note that the Bureau's RCC Data Report illustrates some challenges of metrics-based evaluations. Accordingly, we encourage providers to explore and test a wide range of approaches and, where successful, share those solutions with industry peers and the Commission.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">6. Conversely, we reject the argument that we should mandate the standards and best practices contained in the ATIS RCC Handbook. The ATIS RCC Handbook intermediate provider best practices include, inter alia: Managing the number of intermediate providers (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.</inline> number of “hops”); installation and use of test lines; contractual agreements with intermediate providers to govern intermediate provider conduct; management of direct and indirect looping; maintenance of sufficient direct termination capacity; non-manipulation of signaling information; inheritance of restrictions; intercarrier process requirements; and acceptance testing. As to the manipulation of signaling information, section 64.1601(a)(2) of the Commission's rules already requires intermediate providers within an interstate or intrastate call path that originate and/or terminate on the PSTN to pass unaltered to subsequent <?page num="21725"?>providers in the call path signaling information identifying the telephone number, or billing number, if different, of the calling party that is received with a call. In addition, section 64.2201(b) already requires intermediate providers to return unaltered to providers in the call path any signaling information that indicates that the terminating provider is alerting the called party, such as by ringing. The highly regarded ATIS RCC Handbook is a voluntary, industry collaborative approach to help “ensur[e] call completion” for rural telephone company customers. We agree with commenters that mandating the ATIS RCC Handbook best practices “could have a chilling effect on future industry cooperation to develop solutions to industry problems.”
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">7. However, we also agree with commenters that we should encourage adherence to the ATIS RCC Handbook best practices. As such, while we decline to mandate compliance with the ATIS RCC Handbook best practices, we will treat covered provider adherence to all the ATIS RCC Handbook best practices as a safe harbor that establishes compliance with the monitoring rule. Thus, a covered provider that adheres to all of the ATIS RCC Handbook best practices will be deemed to be compliant with the monitoring rule. This safe harbor applies only to the best practices set forth in the 2015 version of the ATIS RCC Handbook, identified above. We will also take the ATIS RCC Handbook best practices into account in evaluating whether a covered provider has developed sufficiently robust and compliant monitoring processes. We find that this approach will encourage adherence to the best practices while giving covered providers flexibility to tailor their practices to their particular networks and business arrangements. Where a rural telephone company has a test line, we encourage a covered provider to make use of that test line as a part of its regular observation of intermediate provider performance.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">8. We strongly encourage covered providers to limit the number of intermediate providers in the call chain. We specifically encourage covered providers to take advantage of the Managing Intermediate Providers Safe Harbor. Managing the number of intermediate providers in the call chain is an ATIS RCC Handbook best practice, and the record shows that limiting the number of intermediate providers can help ensure call completion to rural areas. By requiring covered providers to monitor and take responsibility for the performance of their intermediate providers, we anticipate that the rules we adopt will encourage covered providers to limit the number of intermediate providers in the call chain. Nevertheless, consistent with our decision to give covered providers flexibility, we decline to mandate a specific limit on the number of intermediate providers in the call chain. Such a mandate would be unduly rigid, as even those who advocate such a mandate acknowledge that exceptions would be needed. We specifically reject HD Tandem's proposal to allow additional intermediate providers only upon a waiver request as unduly burdensome and too slow to be compatible with the dynamic routing needs of covered providers. We are concerned that a specific limit mandate conflates the number of “hops” with good hops; for example, it assumes that a small number of badly performing intermediate providers are better than multiple well-performing intermediate providers. Although proponents of a strict limit argue that it would impose “virtually no burden on originating providers beyond the inclusion of effective clauses in their contracts with their intermediate providers,” the record indicates that covered providers would face additional burdens if they lacked flexibility to efficiently route calls during periods of high call volume such as natural disasters and national security related events. We note that only two covered providers have stated that they meet the Managing Intermediate Provider Safe Harbor, notwithstanding the reduced burdens under the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">RCC Order</inline> that result. This fact suggests that the vast majority of covered providers have concluded that the benefits associated with always limiting to two the number of intermediate providers in the call path do not outweigh the associated costs.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">9. While we decline to impose a strict limit on the number of intermediate providers in the call chain, we recognize that an animating concern of those who advocate for such a limit is avoiding an attenuated call path in which responsibility for problems is difficult or impossible to trace and in which no one party “owns” ensuring successful call completion. As discussed below, we require covered providers to exercise oversight regarding their entire intermediate provider call path to rural destinations. The RCC Act further requires that intermediate providers register with the Commission, and precludes covered providers from using intermediate providers who are not registered. These requirements will help to ensure that covered providers only use responsible intermediate providers and can identify intermediate providers in the call path. We therefore are able to address the underlying problem of diffuse responsibility without imposing a rigid mandate capping the number of intermediate providers.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">10. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Retrospective Monitoring.</inline> We also require covered providers to retrospectively investigate any rural call completion problems that arise. This requirement is consistent with our proposal in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">RCC 2nd FNPRM,</inline> which several commenters support. Evidence of poor performance warranting investigation includes but is not limited to: Persistent low answer or completion rates; unexplained anomalies in performance reflected in the metrics used by the covered provider; repeated complaints to the Commission, state regulatory agencies, or covered providers by customers, rural incumbent LECs and their customers, competitive LECs, and others; or as determined by evolving industry best practices, including the ATIS RCC Handbook.






</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">11. We interpret the retrospective monitoring requirement as encompassing, at minimum, the duties under sections 201, 202, and 217 of the Act set forth in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">2012 Declaratory Ruling.</inline> In that decision, the Bureau clarified that “it is an unjust and unreasonable practice in violation of section 201 of the Act for a carrier that knows or should know that it is providing degraded service to certain areas to fail to correct the problem or to fail to ensure that intermediate providers, least-cost routers, or other entities acting for or employed by the carrier are performing adequately.” The Bureau further clarified that “adopting or perpetuating routing practices that result in lower quality service to rural or high-cost localities than like service to urban or lower cost localities (including other lower cost rural areas) may, in the absence of a persuasive explanation, constitute unjust or unreasonable discrimination in practices, facilities, or services and violate section 202 of the Act.” In the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">2012 Declaratory Ruling,</inline> the Bureau also stated: “Service problems could be particularly problematic for TTY and amplified telephones used by persons with hearing disabilities. Carriers that fail to ensure that services are usable by and accessible to individuals with disabilities may be in violation of section 255 of the Act. Accordingly, practices that result in disparate quality of service delivered to rural areas could be found unlawful under sections 202 and 255 of the Act.” Finally, the Bureau, relying on section 217 of the Act, stated that “if an underlying provider is <?page num="21726"?>blocking, choking, or otherwise restricting traffic, employing other unjust or unreasonable practices in violation of section 201, engaging in unjust or unreasonable discrimination in violation of section 202, or otherwise not complying with the Act or Commission rules, the carrier using that underlying provider to deliver traffic is liable for those actions if the underlying provider is an agent or other person acting for or employed by the carrier.” We both affirm the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">2012 Declaratory Ruling</inline> as a clarification of the statutory provisions discussed by the Bureau and clarify that under the rule we adopt, the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">2012 Declaratory Ruling</inline> sets forth the minimum retrospective monitoring duty of covered providers. The statutory interpretations set forth in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">2012 Declaratory Ruling</inline> (and clarified here) apply to carriers. The duties in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">2012 Declaratory Ruling</inline> (and clarified here) apply to covered providers, and constitute the minimum bounds of the retrospective monitoring requirement. Based on these determinations, we find it unnecessary to codify separately the prohibition on blocking, choking, reducing, or restricting traffic explicated it in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">2012 Declaratory Ruling.</inline>
                                       </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">12. We specifically highlight that under the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">2012 Declaratory Ruling,</inline> “a carrier that knows or should know that calls are not being completed to certain areas, and that engages in acts (or omissions) that allow or effectively allow these conditions to persist” may be liable for a violation of section 201 of the Act. Thus, willful ignorance will not excuse a failure by a covered provider or carrier to investigate evidence of poor performance to a rural area, such as repeated complaints, persistent low answer rates, or other indicia identified above. When this evidence of persistent poor performance exists with respect to a rural area, the provider should know that there may be a problem with calls being completed to that area and it has a duty to investigate. We further clarify that a covered provider or carrier may only deem the duty set forth in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">2012 Declaratory Ruling</inline> satisfied if it: (a) Promptly resolves any anomalies or problems and takes action to ensure they do not recur; or (b) determines that responsibility lies with a party other than the provider itself or any of its downstream providers and uses commercially reasonable efforts to alert that party to the anomaly or problem. Below, we provide additional direction under the monitoring rule we establish regarding how covered providers must fulfill prong (a) above with respect to intermediate providers with which they contract.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">13. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Remedying Problems Detected During Retrospective Monitoring.</inline> We require that, based on the results of the required monitoring, covered providers must take steps that are reasonably calculated to correct any identified performance problem with the intermediate provider, including removing the intermediate provider from a particular route after sustained inadequate performance. We agree with NCTA that “isolated call failures . . . have always been inherent in the exchange of voice traffic,” and clarify that our monitoring rule does not require covered providers to take remedial action solely to address isolated downstream call failures. As USTelecom observed, “carriers have found that the most effective means of identifying and resolving call completion issues has been through their own monitoring which includes investigating specific complaints and ensuring that intermediate providers are held accountable.” Correcting identified performance problems is an important part of ensuring that monitoring leads to real improvements in the call completion process.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">14. Where a covered provider detects a persistent problem based on retrospective monitoring, we require the covered provider to select a solution that is reasonably calculated to be effective. A temporary and quickly abandoned solution is not acceptable. Covered providers that do not effectively correct problems with call completion to specific areas have “allow[ed] the conditions to persist” and are subject to enforcement action for violation of the monitoring rule as well as the Act and our call blocking prohibition thereunder. We agree with NCTA that requiring a “permanent” solution is too rigid and may not account for a rapidly changing marketplace. At the same time, a covered provider's or carrier's responsibility under the monitoring rule and <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">2012 Declaratory Ruling</inline> is not met by a temporary route correction and nothing more; providers and carriers are also responsible for ensuring that the problems do not recur.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">15. Although we give covered providers flexibility in the remedial steps they choose so long as they pursue a solution that is reasonably calculated to be effective, we specifically require removing intermediate providers from routes where warranted. The ATIS RCC Handbook identifies “temporarily or permanently removing the intermediate provider from the routing path” as a best practice when an intermediate provider fails to perform at an acceptable service level, and we agree that this must be among the remedial steps that covered providers must take where appropriate. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) endorses route removal as a remedy and suggests that the only exception for removal of sufficiently badly performing intermediates “should be for call paths for which there are no alternative routes, so long as the lack of an alternative route can be reasonably documented.” We agree with the CPUC and conclude that where an intermediate provider has sustained inadequate performance, removal from a particular route is necessary except where a covered provider can reasonably document that no alternative routes exist. Sustained inadequate performance is manifest when, even if a provider alters routing to a rural area, call completion problems with that provider persist or recur within days, weeks, or months after the routing change.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">16. We reject arguments that fulfilling this obligation is unduly difficult or infeasible. Both the record and information gathered in enforcement investigations indicates that some providers have removed intermediate providers from call paths for poor performance. We disagree with Sprint that identifying “sustained inadequate performance” is “extraordinarily difficult”—if a covered provider fulfills its monitoring duty, it will be able to identify persistent outliers and sources of repeated anomalies or problems. Further, the monitoring requirement we establish forecloses the argument that fulfilling the duty to correct identified performance problems is not feasible because a covered provider hands off traffic without exercising further oversight. The covered provider has the obligation to prevent poor rural call completion performance, and business models that foreclose performing this duty are unacceptable.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">17. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Scope of Monitoring Requirement—Call Attempts to Rural Competitive LECs.</inline> Although our recording, retention, and reporting requirements are limited to calls to incumbent LECs, we require covered providers to monitor rural call completion performance to both rural incumbent and rural competitive LECs. We recognize that rural competitive LEC subscribers also encounter rural call completion issues. Indeed, a significant percentage of the rural call completion complaints received by the Commission are from rural competitive LECs and their customers. In 2013, the Commission declined to extend the <?page num="21727"?>recordkeeping requirements for call attempts to rural competitive LECs because “rural CLEC calling areas generally overlap with nonrural ILEC calling areas, calling patterns to rural CLECs differ from those to rural ILECs, and rural CLECs generally employ different network architectures.” Although these factors illustrate recordkeeping challenges, they do not explain why covered providers have any less responsibility to complete calls to customers of rural competitive LECs or to monitor the performance of intermediate providers that deliver traffic to these providers. In our proposed rule, we used the phrase “rural incumbent LEC,” which we proposed defining as an incumbent LEC that is a rural telephone company, as each of those terms are in <ref href="/us/cfr/t47/s51.5">47 CFR 51.5</ref>. In our final rule, we replace the phrase “rural incumbent LEC” with “rural telephone company,” which encompasses both incumbent and competitive LECs. To ensure that covered providers have adequate information to monitor intermediate provider performance, we direct NECA to prepare on an annual basis and make publicly available a list of rural competitive LEC OCNs in addition to continuing its annual listing of rural and non-rural incumbent LEC OCNs. We recognize that because competitive LECs are not defined by incumbent service territories like incumbent LECs, identifying rural competitive LECs may be difficult in some cases, and NECA's rural competitive LEC OCN list may not be comprehensive. We direct NECA to use best efforts to identify rural competitive LECs and their OCNs for inclusion in the list. We do not require covered providers to monitor calls to rural competitive LECs or their OCNs that do not appear on NECA's list. We nevertheless view requiring monitoring to rural competitive LECs and NECA's preparation of the list as valuable to promote greater call completion to the customers of rural competitive LECs that do appear on the list. We encourage rural competitive LECs to identify their rural OCNs to NECA for use in preparation of this list.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">2. Covered Provider Accountability
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">18. Under the monitoring rule we adopt today, covered providers must exercise responsibility for the performance of the entire intermediate provider call path to help ensure that calls to rural areas are completed. We will hold covered providers accountable for exercising oversight regarding the performance of all intermediate providers in the path of calls for which the covered provider makes the initial long-distance call path choice. We expect covered providers to take remedial measures where necessary and covered providers who fail to remediate problems are subject to enforcement action. As explained below, covered providers may fulfill their monitoring obligation through direct monitoring or a combination of direct monitoring and contractual restrictions.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">19. We find that allocating this responsibility to covered providers is appropriate because, as the entity that makes the initial long-distance call path choice, covered providers are in a position to exercise responsibility over the downstream call path to the terminating LEC. As to covered provider carriers, Verizon correctly notes that our authority under sections 201 and 202, “combined with [the Commission's] . . . longstanding policy,” makes carriers “responsible for the provision of service to their customers even when they contract with intermediate providers to carry calls to their destinations.” Because the definition of “covered provider” excludes entities with low call volumes, we expect that covered providers are of sufficient size to put resources into monitoring and negotiate appropriate provisions with any intermediate providers with which they contract. In stating this, we do not suggest that smaller carriers are free from call completion obligations. We believe that placing responsibility on a single, readily identifiable party that ultimately controls the call path will be an effective measure in addressing rural call completion issues going forward. Further, covered providers are in a position to promptly remedy rural call completion issues when they arise by virtue of their contractual relationships with intermediate providers and their ability to modify call routing paths, enabling rural call completion issues to be resolved without waiting for Commission enforcement action, thereby benefiting rural consumers.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">20. For common carriers, the duty to monitor the entire intermediate provider call path also flows from section 217, which states that “the act, omission, or failure of any officer, agent, or other person acting for or employed by any common carrier or user, acting within the scope of his employment, shall in every case be also deemed to be the act, omission, or failure of such carrier or user as well as that of the person.” As the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">2012 Declaratory Ruling</inline> explained, based on section 217, “a carrier remains responsible for the provision of service to its customers even when it contracts with another provider to carry the call to its destination.” The Commission has applied a similar policy to carriers in the slamming context, as well as to broadcast and wireless licensees. We find it appropriate to apply this same principle to all covered providers for the reasons set forth above. Thus, a covered provider is responsible when, for example, a downstream provider unlawfully injects ring tone on a call, in violation of <ref href="/us/cfr/t47/s64.2201">47 CFR 64.2201</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">21. We give covered providers flexibility in how they fulfill this responsibility to determine the standards and methods best suited to their individual networks. Under the rule we adopt today, a covered provider is accountable for monitoring the performance of any intermediate provider with which it contracts, including that intermediate provider's decision as to whether calls may be handed off to additional downstream intermediate providers—and if so, how many—and whether it has taken sufficient steps to ensure that calls will be completed post-handoff. We require covered providers to directly monitor the performance of intermediate providers with which they have a contractual relationship, and we decline to impose an unnecessarily burdensome mandate requiring direct covered provider monitoring of the entire call chain. We use the term “direct” monitoring to distinguish active monitoring from reliance solely on contractual protections. With respect to “direct” monitoring, we permit covered providers to perform the monitoring themselves or rely on a third-party vendor, acting on behalf of the covered provider, that directly monitors the intermediate provider and reports back to the covered provider. We underscore that covered providers will remain ultimately responsible for monitoring even where they use a third-party vendor. Rather, a covered provider may manage the call path through (i) direct monitoring of all intermediate providers or (ii) a combination of direct monitoring of contracted intermediate providers and contractual restrictions on directly monitored intermediate providers that are reasonably calculated to ensure rural call completion through the responsible use of any further intermediate providers. The ATIS RCC Handbook provides that as a best practice, contractual agreements can be used to ensure that intermediate providers meet performance expectations and hold intermediates accountable for performance. Contractual measures that meet this standard include limiting the use of further intermediate providers and provisions that ensure quality call completion.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">22. We encourage covered providers to incorporate the following provisions, suggested by NASUCA: (1) “[r]equir[ing] each downstream carrier on an ongoing basis to provide specific information regarding its system and the limitations of its system, including information regarding any difficulties its system may have interoperating with other systems using different technologies”; (2) “[r]equir[ig] each downstream carrier on an ongoing basis to provide specific information regarding any bandwidth or other capacity constraints that would prevent its system from completing calls to particular destinations at busy times”; (3) “[r]equir[ing] each downstream carrier to use properly designed and properly functioning alarms in its system that ensure immediate notice of any outages on its system”; (4) “[r]equir[ing] each downstream carrier to use properly designed and properly functioning mechanisms to ensure that the downstream carrier, if unable to complete a call, timely releases the call back to the upstream carrier”; (5) “[r]equir[ing] each downstream carrier to use properly designed and properly functioning mechanisms to ensure that the downstream carrier, if making successive attempts to route the call through different lower-tiered downstream carriers, timely passes the call to a second (or third or fourth) lower-tiered downstream carrier if a first (or second or third) lower-tiered downstream carrier cannot complete it”; (6) “[r]equir[ing] each downstream carrier to use properly designed and properly functioning mechanisms to detect and control looping, including the use of hop counters or other equivalent mechanisms that alert a carrier to the presence of a loop”; (7) “[e]stablish[ing] direct measures of quality and requir[ing] downstream carriers to meet them”; (8) “[e]stablish[ing] and implement[ing] appropriate sanctions for intermediate carriers that fail to meet standards”; (9) “[r]equir[ing] downstream carriers to manage lower-tiered downstream carriers and to hold lower-tiered downstream carriers to the same standards that they themselves are held”; and (10) “[d]efin[ing] the responsibilities of downstream carriers in a written agreement.” Based on these suggestions, including “[e]stablish[ing] direct measures of quality and requir[ing] downstream carriers to meet them,” we do not agree with NCTA that “`direct monitoring' is only feasible with the first intermediate provider in the call path and not with subsequent intermediate providers.” Additionally, we do not see any benefit to foreclosing the option to rely entirely on direct monitoring. Insofar as a covered provider relies on contractual restrictions rather than direct monitoring for downstream intermediate providers, the covered provider must ensure these restrictions flow down the entire intermediate provider call path. For example, suppose calls travel from covered provider X to intermediate providers A, B, and C in turn, and X contracts only with A. X must directly monitor A. X must ensure that A imposes contractual restrictions on B reasonably calculated to ensure rural call completion, and X must ensure that A or B imposes such restrictions on C. Thus, a covered provider may not avoid liability for poor performance by asserting that a rural call went awry at an unknown point down a lengthy chain of intermediate providers or by claiming solely that its contracts with initial downstream vendors prohibited unlawful conduct. Conversely, covered providers that engage in reasonable monitoring efforts will not be held responsible for intermediate provider conduct that is not, or could not be, identified through such reasonable monitoring efforts. This conclusion is consistent with our decision not to impose strict liability under the monitoring rule.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">23. Our balanced approach ensures that covered providers exercise responsibility for rural call completion without imposing an unduly rigid or burdensome mandate. We therefore reject various “all-or-nothing” approaches. We reject the argument that covered providers should not bear any responsibility for the performance of non-contracted intermediate carriers. This argument mistakenly assumes that the covered provider is unable to reach the behavior of downstream intermediate providers through directly contracted intermediate providers, and the record indicates otherwise. Conversely, because we are able to require covered providers to exercise responsibility for the performance of the entire intermediate provider call path while providing significant flexibility in how they do so, we find mandating direct covered provider monitoring of the entire call chain unnecessarily burdensome. Similarly, we do not mandate that covered providers must directly contract with all intermediate providers in the call path. Such a requirement would be superfluous given covered provider responsibility for the overall call path, and we agree with CTIA that such a requirement would unduly prescribe provider conduct. Nonetheless, we encourage covered providers to directly contract with all intermediate providers in the call path consistent with the ATIS RCC Handbook best practices.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">3. Covered Provider Point of Contact
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">24. Communication is key to addressing rural call completion issues. Of particular importance is communication between covered providers, which make the initial long-distance call path choice, and terminating rural LECs. Together, these entities account for the beginning and end of the long-distance call path. While ATIS maintains a contact list of service provider rural call completion points of contact, participation is voluntary, and accordingly the list only contains contact information for a “limited number of covered providers.” To participate in the ATIS NGIIF Service Provider Contact Directory for rural call completion, ATIS asks providers to submit the following information: Toll free number; contact; contact number; email; fax; website; and other information. As NTCA and WTA explain, “[r]ural providers often report that they have no way to contact the responsible originating carrier or if they do, the person they contact has little to no understanding of the issue.” Conversely, when participants in the call chain communicate, they are more likely to resolve issues that arise.






 
 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">25. We agree with NTCA and WTA that we should require covered providers to provide and maintain contact information as a low-cost measure to facilitate industry collaboration to address call completion issues. We therefore will require covered providers to make available on their websites a telephone number and email address for the express purpose of receiving and responding promptly to any rural call completion issues. We note that ATIS requests similar information for its voluntary rural call completion service provider contact directory. We require covered providers to ensure that the contact information available on their website is easy to find and use. Further, covered providers must ensure that any staff reachable through this contact information has the technical capability to promptly respond to and address call completion concerns. As the operators and experts of their individual call networks, covered provider technical staff are best positioned to expeditiously solve issues as they arise and as such should be the first point of contact in identifying and resolving rural call completion issues. We expect that covered providers will ensure that there is a means by which <?page num="21729"?>persons with disabilities can contact them and that the contact information is available on a covered provider's website in a manner accessible by persons with disabilities.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">26. Covered providers must keep the contact information current on their websites, updating with any changes within ten business days. The same timeline for updates applies to contact information placed on websites for responding to closed captioning concerns under our television closed captioning rules. Furthermore, because call completion problems may jeopardize public health and safety, we require covered providers to respond to communications regarding rural call completion issues via the contact information required under the rule we adopt as soon as reasonably practicable and within no more than a single business day under ordinary circumstances. We recognize, however, that complex call completion issues may take longer than a single day to resolve, and clarify that this requirement refers to an initial response in such circumstances and does not indicate that all such issues must be resolved within a single business day.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">27. We expect NECA to use the disclosures we require to establish and maintain a central, public list of covered provider contact information that can be easily accessed by rural providers on NECA's website. To facilitate creation of this list, we encourage covered providers to provide directly to NECA the same contact information that they make available on their websites pursuant to our requirement above, and we encourage covered providers to update NECA if they update the contact information on their websites. We would expect NECA to update its contact information directory regularly so that it remains current. We recognize that ATIS already maintains a voluntary contact directory. We expect NECA, given its role in compiling the list of rural carriers, would work with ATIS to develop a repository of covered provider contact information, ensuring a comprehensive list of covered provider contact information is available for reference by rural providers. We treat the contact information that NECA makes available in the same manner as the contact information that the covered provider makes available on its website in terms of the covered provider's duty to respond in a timely fashion. In other words, we require covered providers to respond to communications regarding rural call completion issues via the contact information that NECA makes available as soon as reasonably practicable, and within no more than a single business day under ordinary circumstances. An additional repository for contact information that is specific to covered providers will further encourage inter-and intra-industry cooperation to address call completion issues by offering carriers a centralized resource that facilitates communication if and when problems occur. We also encourage all providers, including rural providers, to submit their own contact information for inclusion in the ATIS Service Provider Contact Directory, which continues to be a helpful single source of contact information.

We continue to include non-rural OCNs both to facilitate comparisons of rural and non-rural call completion by covered providers and for use in continuing to comply with the recording and retention rules. As noted above, we also direct NECA to prepare a list of rural competitive LEC OCNs on a yearly basis.

We agree with commenters who assert that “the Commission should refrain from mandating specific performance metrics for covered carriers or for their intermediate carriers.” In connection with this, we observe that what constitutes poor rural call completion performance varies according to context. For example, carriers with a high autodialer or robocall volume may experience low answer or completion rates, possibly leading to the conclusion that a low number answer rate percentage is an appropriate benchmark (and thus not poor performance) for such covered providers. Throughout this proceeding, both the Commission and industry have noted that it is uncertain whether covered providers can segregate autodialer and other telemarketing traffic from other types of traffic. In other contexts, that same percentage would be considered poor performance for covered providers originating only residential traffic. Similarly, the RCC Data Report identified a number of challenges in establishing metrics as a result of inaccurate signaling and misalignment in the mapping of ISUP cause codes to SIP response messages. We therefore opt to give individual covered providers flexibility to establish their own methodologies that are appropriate to their networks and systems in monitoring call performance.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">30. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Good Faith.</inline> We reject arguments that we should establish a “good faith” threshold for compliance whereby we would not impose liability on covered providers making “a good faith effort to comply with the rules.” The approach we adopt captures the desire for flexibility underlying some of these requests, and gives covered providers discretion to monitor as they see fit in a manner best suited to their individual networks and business arrangements. We do not impose strict liability on covered providers for a call completion failure; rather, we may impose a penalty where a covered provider fails to take actions to prevent reasonably foreseeable problems or, if it knows or should know that a problem has arisen, where it fails to investigate or take appropriate remedial action. Further, our monitoring rule focuses on persistent problems, and we will not impose liability under the monitoring rule for an isolated call failure. That said, a “good faith” threshold on top of the flexible approach we adopt would add a layer of unhelpful uncertainty as to what constitutes compliance. We are committed to ensuring call completion to all Americans, and we find a “good faith” threshold unduly lenient. We also agree with NASUCA that “[i]njecting subjective questions of motivation into enforcement actions will compromise their effectiveness and compromise the reliability of the network.” We agree with NASUCA that adopting a good faith limitation does not provide greater clarity to our rule.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">31. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Exempt Class of Service.</inline> CenturyLink suggests we allow covered providers to offer a second class of service that would be “exempt from any new call completion rules.” We decline to implement this approach. CenturyLink posits that call completion is “less important” to customers placing marketing calls—as opposed to those originating from residential customers—and therefore these calls should be exempt from any rural call completion monitoring requirements. This second class would presumably include autodialer traffic.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">32. We reject allowing an exempt class of service for several reasons. First, we believe all Americans deserve all lawful calls to be completed, regardless <?page num="21730"?>of their purpose. In particular, calling parties should not be able to decide unilaterally which calls rural Americans deserve to receive reliably. We also prefer an approach that is potentially over-inclusive in ensuring call completion compared to a system that is potentially under-inclusive. Next, the present call signaling system does not distinguish between residential calls and any other call made to a residential area. Because it therefore is not possible to evaluate a covered provider's class categorization decision, a covered provider could categorize traffic inaccurately to suggest superior call completion performance (and thus imply superior monitoring) without the possibility of detection. Finally, a two-class practice could lead to violations of section 201 of the Act insofar as it entails a carrier that knows or should know that calls are not being completed to certain areas engaging in acts or omissions that allow or effectively allow these conditions to persist.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">33. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Certification, Audit, or Disclosure Requirement.</inline> We decline to impose a certification or audit requirement in conjunction with the monitoring rule. The CPUC asserts that “[a] certification or audit requirement would make clear to covered providers and intermediate providers the importance that the FCC attaches to rural call completion,” but, recognizing that “[s]uch a requirement could be burdensome and costly,” suggests a one-year reporting interval. We expect all entities subject to our rules to comply at all times, and our actions today demonstrate the importance to us of ensuring that calls are completed to all Americans. Additionally, numerous covered providers attest that they are committed to ensuring that rural calls are completed, and we expect them to live up to this commitment. We decline to impose what we agree would be a costly requirement absent a clear and sufficiently tangible (as opposed to rhetorical) benefit.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">34. We further decline to require covered providers to file their documented monitoring procedures publicly with the Commission, as NTCA suggests. NTCA contends that because we expect covered providers to document their processes for prospective monitoring, a filing requirement “imposes no meaningful burden.” But such documentation in many cases is likely to reveal important technical, personnel, and commercial details about the covered provider's network and business operations—so public disclosure would impose meaningful burdens. To the extent that a covered provider would be able to successfully obtain confidential treatment for part or all of its disclosure, it would mitigate the harm of disclosure but also would undercut any purported benefits. There is no countervailing benefit sufficient to warrant imposing this burden. We are able to obtain information on covered providers' monitoring practices in an investigation, so we do not need to impose a public disclosure requirement to effectively carry out our responsibilities. We therefore do not agree that a disclosure requirement would give covered providers “greater incentives to comply with procedures on file with the Commission.” We reiterate that we expect covered providers—and all regulated entities—to comply with our rules, and we are able to take enforcement action where they do not. Given the variance among covered providers' networks and operations and the flexibility our monitoring rule provides, we see little value to covered providers “know[ing] what individual carriers' procedures are and hav[ing] benchmarks against which subsequent performance can be measured”—each covered provider is able to adopt its own approach.
</p>

Recommended as an ATIS best practice to help resolve call completion issues, test lines “can expedite trouble resolution, avoid Customer Propriety Network Information-related issues and exclude problems that may be specific to the called party's access and customer premises equipment arrangements.” However, the record is silent as to what added costs and logistical burdens this mandate would impose on rural carriers. Further, NTCA and WTA assert that test lines may generate false positives and have the ability to handle a limited number of test calls at any given time—sometimes only one. Verizon also contends that “[i]n [its] experience, there is no correlation between test-line results and rural call completion performance.” Because it is not clear whether the benefits of greater availability of test lines will outweigh any burden to rural LECs and subscribers, we decline to mandate activation of test lines at this time. However, we encourage, but do not require, covered providers to make use of test lines where available in monitoring intermediate provider performance, and we encourage rural carriers to make test lines available to covered providers.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">36. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Trunk Augmentation.</inline> We decline to adopt HD Tandem's proposal to require carriers to augment trunks used for RCC paths when they reach a monthly utilization rate of 80%. We agree with Verizon that mandating “when and how carriers must purchase trunking capacity . . . contravene[s] the Commission's goal of ensuring covered providers have the flexibility they need.” Although HD Tandem asserts that “[w]hen trunk utilization exceeds 80%, the risk of dropped calls and poor quality calls dramatically increases” and that “[m]any tariffs require augmentation of trunks when they reach a utilization of 80% or more,” it does not substantiate these claims. We decline to impose a precise mandate absent more details justifying the threshold HD Tandem suggests. The record does not contain enough detail confirming the costs or benefits of such a requirement to allow us to weigh any added benefits against the burden upon network flexibility and potential monetary compliance cost.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">37. At the same time, we agree that maintaining adequate capacity is an important part of monitoring rural call completion performance. The ATIS RCC Handbook recommends that “it is important for the original IXC to maintain sufficient termination facilities that it can complete its own traffic when an intermediate provider cannot complete the call” because “[g]iven the cost challenges” intermediate providers have “to maintain a lean network and the aggregation of loads from multiple IXCs they must handle, there is a greater chance that, on a moment-to-moment basis, [intermediate providers] will not have capacity to complete a call” and “[m]aintaining its own termination capacity gives an IXC flexibility to quickly stop using an intermediate provider should performance problems develop.” Thus, while we do not mandate trunk augmentation at a specific utilization threshold, maintaining adequate capacity is an important part of being able to monitor the performance of intermediate providers and meet the rural call completion monitoring rule we adopt today.

We are persuaded that covered providers will need some time to evaluate and renegotiate contracts with intermediate providers in order to comply with the monitoring requirement. We reject NCTA's argument that such a transition period should last twelve months, however; the monitoring requirement addresses the ongoing call completion problems faced by rural Americans, and delay only <?page num="21731"?>postpones when rural Americans will see the fruit of this solution. A six-month transition period will suffice to address NCTA's concerns while not unduly delaying the effective date of the monitoring rule. The monitoring rule therefore will go into effect six months from the date that this Order is released by the Commission, or 30 days after publication of a summary of this Order in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>, whichever is later. NCTA suggests that the monitoring requirement will be subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and that its effective date should be tied to “notice that the rule[ has] been approved by [OMB].” Because the monitoring requirement does not require approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act, we do not tie the effective date to OMB approval.

We therefore direct the Bureau, in conjunction with the Enforcement Bureau and the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, to review the progress that has been made in addressing rural call completion issues, and the effectiveness of our rules, within two years of the effective date of the rules. We direct the Bureau to publish its findings in a report that will be made available for public comment. We expect this report to benefit the Commission in its ongoing work to address rural call completion issues.

We decline to adopt NTCA's recommendation that “the rules adopted in this order sunset after three years and revert to the rules [previously] in effect, absent a finding based on evidence and analysis that the new framework as adopted addresses rural call completion problems.” NTCA does not provide any examples of the Commission making use of this kind of `sunset and reversion' approach to rulemaking. The rules we adopt today are tailored to provide a more efficient and effective means to address persistent rural call completion issues than our prior rules. And, as outlined in the Further Notice, we propose and seek comment on further modifications to our rural call completion rules, including those we adopt today, as we work to implement the RCC Act. Imposing an arbitrary expiration date on these rules is therefore unnecessary and counterproductive, as it could undermine their overall effectiveness.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">41. We retain the Commission's current definition of “covered provider,” adopted in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">RCC Order.</inline> We agree with the CPUC that this scope is “a reasonable trade-off between covering an adequate number of calls without placing a burden on those smaller carriers that would be least able to bear it.” We note that, regardless of size, all carriers are subject to the statutory requirements of the Act, including sections 201, 202, and 217, <ref href="/us/usc/t47/s201">47 U.S.C. 201</ref>, 202, 217, and that VoIP providers are prohibited from blocking calls to or from the PSTN. No commenter to the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">RCC 2nd FNPRM</inline> opposes this definition.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">42. Because we require each covered provider to monitor calls to rural incumbent LECs and competitive LECs, the definition of “rural incumbent LECs” we proposed in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">RCC 2nd FNPRM</inline> is no longer relevant. We proposed defining a “rural incumbent LEC” as an incumbent LEC that is a rural telephone company, as those terms are defined in <ref href="/us/cfr/t47/s51.5">47 CFR 51.5</ref>. We instead employ the term “rural telephone company,” as that term is defined in <ref href="/us/cfr/t47/s51.5">47 CFR 51.5</ref>. This term reaches the same scope of rural incumbent LECs captured by our proposed definition, and it also includes rural competitive LECs. We clarify that a determination that a competitive LEC meets the definition of a “rural telephone company” for purposes of our rural call completion rules has no bearing on whether a competitive LEC meets the definition of a “rural CLEC” for purposes of section 61.26 of the Commission's rules. We decline to exclude LECs engaged in access stimulation, as defined in <ref href="/us/cfr/t47/s61.3/bbb">47 CFR 61.3(bbb)</ref>, from the definition of rural telephone company for purposes of our rural call completion rules. AT&amp;T does not adequately explain how the monitoring rule we adopt today “benefit[s] access stimulation LECs” or how including all rural telephone companies within the scope of the rule “does not service consumers' best interests.” AT&amp;T's filing (submitted just before the proceeding closed for filings) did not attempt to quantify or otherwise specify the benefits that would accrue to access stimulation LECs or the extent to which those purported benefits would outweigh the benefits of broadly defining “rural telephone company” for purposes of this proceeding. Based on this incomplete record, we do not have enough information to decide the issue raised by AT&amp;T at this time.

The Commission has previously articulated its direct and ancillary authority to adopt rules addressing rural call completion issues, and we rely on that same authority here. In addition to the authority previously articulated, section 217 of the Act provides additional authority to mandate that covered provider carriers monitor the overall intermediate provider call path and correct any identified intermediate provider performance problems. Intermediate providers in the call path “act for” the covered provider; therefore, without holding covered providers responsible for the acts or omissions they initiate to and through intermediate providers, we cannot ensure that covered provider carriers are fulfilling their statutory duties.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">45. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Discussion.</inline> We eliminate the reporting requirement for covered providers. We conclude that the existing reporting rules are burdensome on covered providers, while the resulting Form 480 reports are of limited utility to us in discovering the source of rural call completion problems. We agree with CTIA that the rules “impose[ ] significant costs on covered providers,” and that compliance costs can “divert `funds that covered providers could otherwise use to deploy broadband service, improve network quality, or offer richer service plans.'” We agree with the Bureau's negative evaluation of the reporting requirement and, based on the shortcomings it identified, reject the view that we should retain the reporting requirements as-is.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">46. We find that the burdens associated with supplementing or replacing the existing reporting requirements are likely to outweigh any benefits to the data collection. We therefore decline to amend our reporting rule. We agree with the Bureau's conclusion in the RCC Data Report and commenters who suggest that addressing the ongoing data quality issues associated with Form 480 by supplementing or replacing the data collection rules with new requirements is likely to be prohibitively burdensome on covered providers, while potentially providing little value over the current regime. The record supports the <?page num="21732"?>conclusion that standardization of the data collection is likely to be prohibitively costly while yielding an uncertain benefit. As Verizon explains, the “significant resources providers expended to develop and build data systems to comply with the 2013 <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">RCC Order</inline> are now sunk costs” and we “should not force providers to incur a second round of burdens and costs to comply with modified or new recording, retention, and reporting obligations that likely would be as ineffective as their predecessors.” For these reasons, we also decline to supplement or replace our existing recording and retention rules with any new data collection requirements.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">47. The monitoring rule we adopt will be more effective in promoting covered provider compliance and facilitating enforcement where needed than the reporting rules because the monitoring rule imposes a direct, substantive obligation and because the reporting rules have proven to be not as effective as originally hoped. Furthermore, as the Commission has found previously, rural call completion problems are likely to be addressed especially effectively by ongoing intercarrier compensation reform, a conclusion that is supported by the record. Removal of the reporting requirement will provide covered providers with prompt relief by obviating the need to spend time and resources compiling and filing reports that would otherwise be due to the Commission on <date date="2018-05-01">May 1, 2018</date>. Because we eliminate the reporting requirement, we eliminate section 64.2109, which provided that “[p]roviders subject to the reporting requirements in § 64.2105 of this chapter may make requests for Commission nondisclosure of the data submitted under § 0.459 of this chapter by so indicating on the report at the time that the data are submitted” and that “[t]he Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau will release information to states upon request, if the states are able to maintain the confidentiality of this information.” We will continue to treat reports already submitted to the Commission in accordance with the prior rule, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> we will honor confidentiality requests to the same extent as previously and will release information previously provided to the Commission to states that have requested access and are able to maintain the confidentiality of the information.

As we implement the rules we adopt today and as we continue to pursue more effective solutions to rural call completion problems through further intercarrier compensation reform and RCC Act implementation, we anticipate that the value of the recording and retention rules will diminish. These reforms include both the reductions in terminating switched access rates established by the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">USF/ICC Transformation Order</inline> and further intercarrier compensation reform that we anticipate undertaking. We seek comment in today's <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</inline> on whether to eliminate those requirements upon implementation of the RCC Act. Although we retain the recording and retention requirements at present, we emphatically reject the view that eliminating some or all of the data collection “send[s] a signal” that rural call completion problems are “a low priority for the Commission.” The rules we adopt today, our efforts to implement the RCC Act, and our intercarrier compensation reform efforts show that ensuring calls are completed to all Americans is a top priority for us.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">2. Safe Harbor
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">49. In the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">RCC Order,</inline> the Commission instituted a safe harbor provision reducing the recording, retention, and reporting requirements. Specifically, the safe harbor qualifications require that a covered provider have: (1) No more than one additional intermediate provider in call path before termination; (2) a non-disclosure agreement with intermediate providers allowing the covered provider to identify its intermediates to the Commission and to rural LECs affected by intermediate provider performance; and (3) a process in place to monitor intermediate provider performance. Additionally, the RCC Act contains an exemption from its quality of service requirements for covered providers that meet our safe harbor requirements.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">50. Following adoption of this Order, covered providers qualifying for the safe harbor will continue to be subject to reduced recording and retention requirements. And, upon our adoption of rules implementing the RCC Act, covered providers who qualify for the safe harbor provisions of section 64.2107(a) will also be exempt from the quality of service requirements of the RCC Act, per new section 262(h) of the Act. Retaining these safe harbor provisions will maintain the incentive for covered providers' to engage in call routing to rural areas that minimizes the use of multiple intermediate providers, a practice that contributes to rural call completion issues. We remind covered providers that safe harbor status can be revoked at any time by the Commission for covered providers that violate Commission rules, or are found to no longer be in compliance with the safe harbor provisions.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">51. We decline to institute the amendments to the safe harbor qualifications suggested by Verizon, including allowing the “<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">de minimis</inline>” use of a third intermediate provider during network congestion or outages, and clarifying that the safe harbor applies only to rural LEC destined traffic. We find Verizon's suggestion that we limit the safe-harbor certification to traffic destined to rural LECs contrary to the objective of the safe harbor, which is intended to discourage the use of multiple different intermediate providers. Verizon suggests that we create a presumption that use of an additional intermediate provider for a small percentage (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> not more than 3%) of all calls is part of a “bona fide network overflow arrangement” and would not invalidate a covered provider's safe-harbor status. Verizon's proposed threshold is based on internal review of its overflow traffic on a single day in December 2013, on which it observed that “only 0.1% of its traffic on that day went to its overflow provider for termination.” However, Verizon does not explain how the findings of its single-day study support a 3% <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">de minimis</inline> threshold for overflow routing applicable to all covered providers, and it acknowledges that other providers “may have different arrangements for overflow.” We therefore reject this proposal. Furthermore, codifying these changes to our rules would require the Commission to either set a threshold for congestion, or allow providers to set it themselves, which could undermine the purpose of the safe harbor regime we have established. Allowing covered providers to set their own thresholds could result in a wide range of varying standards that would effectively render the safe harbor meaningless. Alternatively, the Commission setting a congestion threshold would raise the same problems as setting performance thresholds with respect to the monitoring requirement we adopt.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">53. In this Order, we revise our rules to better address ongoing problems in the completion of long-distance telephone calls to rural areas. Specifically, we require covered providers to monitor intermediate provider performance, and eliminate the data reporting requirements created by the Commission in 2013. The requirements we adopt today will be more effective and less burdensome than the prior reporting regime established in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">RCC Order.</inline>
                                       </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">54. All Americans should have confidence that when a call is made to them, they will receive it. But for Americans living in rural or remote areas of the country, too often that is not the case. Call completion problems manifest in a variety of ways—for example, callers may experience false ring tones or busy signals while the called party's phone may never ring at all; or when a call goes through, one or both parties to a call may be unable to hear the other; or the caller ID may show an inaccurate number; or calls to rural numbers may be significantly delayed. Regardless of how the caller and/or called party experiences a call completion problem, the failures have serious repercussions, imposing needless economic and personal costs, and potentially threatening public safety in local communities. We continue to conclude that a key reason for rural call completion issues is that calls to rural areas are often handled by numerous different providers, and that providers' incentives to minimize their intercarrier compensation payments contributes to problems involving carriers blocking or degrading traffic to rural areas.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">55. The actions that we take today demonstrate and reflect our continued commitment to solve the ongoing problems in the completion of long-distance telephone calls to rural areas using a multi-faceted approach requiring diverse solutions and aggressive action by all participants in the call completion process. Given our experience collecting and analyzing rural call completion data and addressing rural call completion problems identified by rural consumers, we reorient our existing rural call completion rules to better reflect strategies that have worked to reduce rural call completion problems while at the same time reducing the overall burden of our rules on providers. Our new measures are informed by the record in this proceeding and our investigations of entities that have failed to ensure that calls are appropriately routed and delivered to rural areas.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">56. First, we adopt a new rule requiring “covered providers”—entities that select the initial long-distance route for a large number of lines—to monitor the performance of the “intermediate providers” to which they hand off calls. By holding a central party responsible for call completion issues, it will be less likely for calls to “fall through the cracks” along a lengthy chain of intermediate providers. The monitoring rule encourages covered providers to ensure that calls are completed, assigns clear responsibility for call completion issues, and enhances our ability to take enforcement action where needed. To facilitate communication about problems that arise, we also require covered providers to make available a point of contact to address rural call completion issues. Our balanced approach ensures that covered providers exercise responsibility for rural call completion without imposing an unduly rigid or burdensome mandate; in addition, it seeks to expedite both the identification and resolution of call completion issues if and when they arise.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">57. Next, we eliminate the reporting requirement for covered providers established in 2013 in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">RCC Order.</inline> We conclude that the existing reporting rules are burdensome on covered providers, while the resulting Form 480 reports are of limited utility to us in discovering the source of rural call completion problems and a pathway to their resolution. We further conclude that the monitoring rule we adopt will be more effective than the less-effective-than-hoped reporting obligation because it imposes a direct, substantive obligation.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">60. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities that may be affected by the final rules adopted pursuant to the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">RCC 2nd FNPRM.</inline> The RFA generally defines the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small organization,” and “small governmental jurisdiction.” In addition, the term “small business” has the same meaning as the term “small-business concern” under the Small Business Act. A “small-business concern” is one which: (1) Is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">61. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions.</inline> Our actions, over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present. We therefore describe here, at the outset, three comprehensive small entity size standards that could be directly affected herein. First, while there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility analysis, according to data from the SBA's Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is an independent business having fewer than 500 employees. These types of small businesses represent 99.9% of all businesses in the United States which translates to 28.8 million businesses.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">62. Next, the type of small entity described as a “small organization” is generally “any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.” Nationwide, as of Aug 2016, there were approximately 356,494 small organizations based on registration and tax data filed by nonprofits with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">63. Finally, the small entity described as a “small governmental jurisdiction” is defined generally as “governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.” U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2012 Census of Governments indicates that there were 90,056 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States. Of this number there were 37,132 General purpose governments (county, municipal and town or township) with populations of less than 50,000 and <?page num="21734"?>12,184 Special purpose governments (independent school districts and special districts) with populations of less than 50,000. The 2012 U.S. Census Bureau data for most types of governments in the local government category shows that the majority of these governments have populations of less than 50,000. Based on this data we estimate that at least 49,316 local government jurisdictions fall in the category of “small governmental jurisdictions.”
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">64. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Wired Telecommunications Carriers.</inline> The U.S. Census Bureau defines this industry as “establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access to transmission facilities and infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using wired communications networks. Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a combination of technologies. Establishments in this industry use the wired telecommunications network facilities that they operate to provide a variety of services, such as wired telephony services, including VoIP services, wired (cable) audio and video programming distribution, and wired broadband internet services. By exception, establishments providing satellite television distribution services using facilities and infrastructure that they operate are included in this industry.” The SBA has developed a small business size standard for Wired Telecommunications Carriers, which consists of all such companies having 1,500 or fewer employees. Census data for 2012 shows that there were 3,117 firms that operated that year. Of this total, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees. Thus, under this size standard, the majority of firms in this industry can be considered small.

The closest applicable NAICS Code category is for Wired Telecommunications Carriers, as defined in paragraph 11 of this FRFA. Under that size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees. Census data for 2012 show that there were 3,117 firms that operated that year.

Consequently, the Commission estimates that most providers of incumbent local exchange service are small businesses that may be affected by the rules and policies adopted. One thousand three hundred and seven (1,307) Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers reported that they were incumbent local exchange service providers. Of this total, an estimated 1,006 have 1,500 or fewer employees.

Of that number, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees. Based on this data, the Commission concludes that the majority of Competitive LECs, CAPs, Shared-Tenant Service Providers, and Other Local Service Providers are small entities. According to Commission data, 1,442 carriers reported that they were engaged in the provision of either competitive local exchange services or competitive access provider services. Of these 1,442 carriers, an estimated 1,256 have 1,500 or fewer employees. In addition, 17 carriers have reported that they are Shared-Tenant Service Providers, and all 17 are estimated to have 1,500 or fewer employees. In addition, 72 carriers have reported that they are Other Local Service Providers. Of this total, 70 have 1,500 or fewer employees. Consequently, the Commission estimates that most providers of competitive local exchange service, competitive access providers, Shared-Tenant Service Providers, and Other Local Service Providers are small entities that may be affected by the adopted rules.

The applicable size standard under SBA rules is that such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees. According to Commission data, 359 companies reported that their primary telecommunications service activity was the provision of interexchange services. Of this total, an estimated 317 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 42 have more than 1,500 employees. Consequently, the Commission estimates that the majority of interexchange service providers are small entities that may be affected by rules adopted.

Under that SBA definition, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees. According to the Commission's Form 499 Filer Database, 500 companies reported that they were engaged in the provision of prepaid calling cards. The Commission does not have data regarding how many of these 500 companies have 1,500 or fewer employees. Consequently, the Commission estimates that there are 500 or fewer prepaid calling card providers that may be affected by the rules.

The appropriate size standard under SBA rules is that such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees. For this industry, Census data for 2012 show that there were 967 firms that operated for the entire year. Of this total, 955 firms had fewer than 1,000 employees. Thus under this category and the associated size standard, the Commission estimates that the majority of wireless telecommunications carriers (except satellite) are small entities. Similarly, according to internally developed Commission data, 413 carriers reported that they were engaged in the provision of wireless telephony, including cellular service, Personal Communications Service (PCS), and Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) services. Of this total, an estimated 261 have 1,500 or fewer employees. Consequently, the Commission estimates that approximately half of these firms can be considered small. Thus, using available data, we estimate that the majority of wireless firms can be considered small.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">74. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Wireless Communications Services.</inline> This service can be used for fixed, mobile, radiolocation, and digital audio broadcasting satellite uses. The Commission defined “small business” for the wireless communications services (WCS) auction as an entity with average gross revenues of $40 million for each of the three preceding years, and a “very small business” as an entity with average gross revenues of $15 million for each of the three preceding years. The SBA has approved these definitions.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">75. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Wireless Telephony.</inline> Wireless telephony includes cellular, personal communications services, and specialized mobile radio telephony carriers. As noted, the SBA has developed a small business size standard for Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite). Under the SBA small business size standard, a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees. According to Commission data, 413 carriers reported that they were engaged in wireless telephony. Of these, an estimated 261 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 152 have more than 1,500 employees. Therefore, a little less than one third of these entities can be considered small.

The broadcast programming is typically narrowcast in nature (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.</inline> limited format, such as news, sports, education, or youth-oriented). These establishments produce programming in their own facilities or acquire programming from external sources. The programming material is usually delivered to a third party, such as cable systems or direct-to-home satellite systems, for transmission to viewers. The SBA has established a size standard for this industry stating that a business in this industry is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees. The 2012 Economic Census indicates that 367 firms were operational for that entire year. Of this total, 357 operated with less than 1,000 employees. Accordingly we conclude that a substantial majority of firms in this industry are small under the applicable SBA size standard.

Under the Commission's rules, a “small cable company” is one serving 400,000 or fewer subscribers nationwide. Industry data indicate that there are currently 4,600 active cable systems in the United States. Of this total, all but nine cable operators nationwide are small under the 400,000-subscriber size standard. In addition, under the Commission's rate regulation rules, a “small system” is a cable system serving 15,000 or fewer subscribers. Current Commission records show 4,600 cable systems nationwide. Of this total, 3,900 cable systems have fewer than 15,000 subscribers, and 700 systems have 15,000 or more subscribers, based on the same records. Thus, under this standard as well, we estimate that most cable systems are small entities.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">78. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Cable System Operators (Telecom Act Standard).</inline> The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, also contains a size standard for small cable system operators, which is “a cable operator that, directly or through an affiliate, serves in the aggregate fewer than one percent of all subscribers in the United States and is not affiliated with any entity or entities whose gross annual revenues in the aggregate exceed $250,000,000 are approximately 52,403,705 cable video subscribers in the United States today. Accordingly, an operator serving fewer than 524,037 subscribers shall be deemed a small operator if its annual revenues, when combined with the total annual revenues of all its affiliates, do not exceed $250 million in the aggregate. Based on available data, we find that all <?page num="21736"?>but nine incumbent cable operators are small entities under this size standard. We note that the Commission neither requests nor collects information on whether cable system operators are affiliated with entities whose gross annual revenues exceed $250 million. Although it seems certain that some of these cable system operators are affiliated with entities whose gross annual revenues exceed $250,000,000, we are unable at this time to estimate with greater precision the number of cable system operators that would qualify as small cable operators under the definition in the Communications Act.

This industry also includes establishments primarily engaged in providing satellite terminal stations and associated facilities connected with one or more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting telecommunications to, and receiving telecommunications from, satellite systems. Establishments providing internet services or voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services via client supplied telecommunications connections are also included in this industry.” The SBA has developed a small business size standard for “All Other Telecommunications,” which consists of all such firms with gross annual receipts of $32.5 million or less. For this category, Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 1,442 firms that operated for the entire year. Of those firms, a total of 1,400 had annual receipts less than $25 million. Consequently, we conclude that the majority of All Other Telecommunications firms can be considered small.

In this <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Order,</inline> we revise our rules to better address ongoing problems in the completion of long-distance telephone calls to rural areas. Specifically, we require covered providers to actively monitor intermediate provider performance, and eliminate the data reporting requirements created by the Commission in 2013.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">81.

Required monitoring entails both prospective evaluation to prevent problems and retrospective investigation of any problems that arise. We also require covered providers take steps that are reasonably calculated to correct any identified performance problem with the intermediate provider. Additionally, we specify that covered providers must publish point of contact information for rural call completion issues.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">83. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant, specifically small business, alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following four alternatives (among others): (1) The establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the rules for such small entities; (3) the use of performance rather than design standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for such small entities.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">84. The <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Order</inline> adopts reforms that are likely to reduce burdens on covered providers, including small entities. As described in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Order,</inline> in adopting these reforms, we have sought comment on the impact of our rule changes on smaller providers, and considered significant alternatives. Regarding our intermediate provider monitoring requirement for covered providers, we considered, but declined to adopt, a mandate that covered providers adhere to the standards and best practices outlined in the ATIS <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Intercarrier Call Completion/Call Termination Handbook</inline> (ATIS RCC Handbook), finding that mandating the ATIS RCC Handbook best practices could have a chilling effect on future industry cooperation to develop solutions to industry problems, and that covered providers should have the flexibility to determine the standards and methods best suited to their individual networks.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">85. Under the monitoring requirement, covered providers must exercise responsibility for the entire intermediate provider call path to help ensure that calls to rural areas are completed. Because “covered providers” excludes entities with low call volumes, we expect that covered providers are of sufficient size to negotiate appropriate provisions with any intermediate providers with which they contract. As stated above, although we encourage limiting the use of intermediate providers, we do not impose a rigid cap on the number of intermediate providers. Similarly, we do not mandate that covered providers must contract with all intermediate providers in the call path. In adopting this approach, we considered, but declined to adopt, a requirement that covered providers directly monitor the performance of intermediate providers with which they lack a contractual relationship. Because covered providers must monitor the performance of intermediate providers with which they contract and must ensure that those covered providers take appropriate measures to ensure calls are completed, we find mandating direct covered provider monitoring of the entire call chain unnecessarily burdensome. Regarding our requirement that covered providers provide and maintain point of contact information for rural call completion issues, we find that this is a low-cost measure to facilitate industry collaboration to address call completion issues.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">86. Further, we considered, but declined to adopt, specific performance targets or benchmarks for call answer rates, call completion rates, or any other performance metric, or certification or audit requirements in conjunction with the monitoring rule, finding the burdens associated with these approaches to outweigh their likely benefits. For the same reason, after consideration, we declined to adopt a mandate that terminating rural carriers activate an automated test line, or augment trunks used for RCC paths when they reach a monthly utilization rate of 80%.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">87. Regarding our recording, retention, and reporting requirements, we find that eliminating the data reporting requirements created by the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">RCC Order</inline> is likely to offer a better and more efficient balance between our need for information pertaining to rural call completion problems and the burdens such data collection efforts place on service providers, including any affected small entities. In adopting this approach, we considered, but declined <?page num="21737"?>to adopt, a modified or supplementary data collection requirement, finding that the burdens of such an approach on covered providers would outweigh the likely benefits.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under the ESA, <ref href="/us/usc/t16/s1531">16 U.S.C. 1531</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.,</inline> NMFS has the responsibility to implement programs to conserve marine life listed as endangered or threatened. All sea turtles found in U.S. waters are listed as either endangered or threatened under the ESA. Kemp's ridley (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Lepidochelys kempii</inline>), loggerhead (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Caretta caretta;</inline> North Pacific distinct population segment), leatherback (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Dermochelys coriacea</inline>), and hawksbill (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Eretmochelys imbricata</inline>) sea turtles are listed as endangered. Loggerhead (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Caretta caretta;</inline> Northwest Atlantic distinct population segment), green (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Chelonia mydas;</inline> North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and East Pacific distinct population segments), and olive ridley (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Lepidochelys olivacea</inline>) sea turtles are listed as threatened, except for breeding colony populations of olive ridleys on the Pacific coast of Mexico, which are listed as endangered. Due to the inability to distinguish between populations of olive ridley turtles away from the nesting beach, NMFS considers these turtles endangered wherever they occur in U.S. waters. While some sea turtle populations have shown signs of recovery, many populations continue to decline.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Incidental take, or bycatch, in fishing gear is the primary anthropogenic source of sea turtle injury and mortality in U.S. waters. Section 9 of the ESA prohibits the take (defined to include harassing, harming, pursuing, hunting, shooting, wounding, killing, trapping, capturing, or collecting or attempting to engage in any such conduct), including incidental take, of endangered sea turtles. Pursuant to section 4(d) of the ESA, NMFS has issued regulations extending the prohibition of take, with exceptions, to threatened sea turtles (<ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s223.205">50 CFR 223.205</ref> and 223.206). Section 11 of the ESA provides for civil and criminal penalties for anyone who violates the Act or a regulation issued to implement the Act. NMFS may grant exceptions to <?page num="21739"?>the take prohibitions with an incidental take statement or an incidental take permit issued pursuant to ESA section 7 or 10, respectively. To do so, NMFS must determine that the activity that will result in incidental take is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the affected listed species. For some Federal fisheries and most state fisheries, NMFS has not granted an exception for incidental takes of sea turtles primarily because we lack information about fishery-sea turtle interactions.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The most effective way for NMFS to learn more about sea turtle-fishery interactions in order to implement the take prohibitions and prevent or minimize take is to place observers aboard fishing vessels. In 2007, NMFS issued a regulation (<ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s222.402">50 CFR 222.402</ref>) establishing procedures to annually identify, pursuant to specified criteria and after notice and opportunity for comment, those fisheries in which the agency intends to place observers (<ref href="/us/fr/72/43176">72 FR 43176</ref>; <date date="2007-08-03">August 3, 2007</date>). These regulations specify that NMFS may place observers on U.S. fishing vessels, commercial or recreational, operating in U.S. territorial waters, the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ), or on the high seas, or on vessels that are otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements under this rule may result in enforcement action.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS will pay the direct costs for vessels to carry observers. These include observer salary and insurance costs. NMFS may also evaluate other potential direct costs, should they arise. Once selected, a fishery will be required to carry observers, if requested, for a period of five years without further action by NMFS. This will enable NMFS to develop an appropriate sampling protocol to investigate whether, how, when, where, and under what conditions incidental takes are occurring; to evaluate whether existing measures are minimizing or preventing takes; and to implement ESA take prohibitions and conserve turtles.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Pursuant to <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s222.402">50 CFR 222.402</ref>, NOAA's Assistant Administrator for Fisheries (AA), in consultation with Regional Administrators and Fisheries Science Center Directors, develops a proposed AD identifying which fisheries are required to carry observers, if requested, to monitor potential interactions with sea turtles. NMFS provides an opportunity for public comment on any proposed AD. The best available scientific, commercial, or other information regarding sea turtle-fishery interactions; sea turtle distribution; sea turtle strandings; fishing techniques, gears used, target species, seasons and areas fished; and/or qualitative data from logbooks or fisher reports informs the AD. Specifically, this AD is based on the extent to which:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(1) The fishery operates in the same waters and at the same time as sea turtles are present;
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(2) The fishery operates at the same time or prior to elevated sea turtle strandings; or
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(3) The fishery uses a gear or technique that is known or likely to result in incidental take of sea turtles based on documented or reported takes in the same or similar fisheries; and
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(4) NMFS intends to monitor the fishery and anticipates that it will have the funds to do so.

The LOF includes all known state and Federal commercial fisheries that occur in U.S. waters and on the high seas. In preparing an AD, however, we do not rely on the three-part MMPA LOF classification scheme. In addition, unlike the LOF, an AD may include recreational fisheries likely to interact with sea turtles based on the best available information.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS consulted with appropriate state and Federal fisheries officials to identify which fisheries, both commercial and recreational, to consider. NMFS carefully considered all recommendations and information available for developing the proposed AD. This is not an exhaustive or comprehensive list of all fisheries with documented or suspected takes of sea turtles. For other fisheries, NMFS may already be addressing incidental take through another mechanism (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> rulemaking to implement modifications to fishing gear and/or practices), may be observing the fishery under a separate statutory authority, or will consider including them in future ADs based on the four previously noted criteria (<ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s222.402/a">50 CFR 222.402(a)</ref>). The fisheries not included on the 2018 AD may still be observed under a different authority (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> MMPA, Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA)) than the ESA, if applicable.

Specifically, <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s600.746/c">50 CFR 600.746(c)</ref> requires vessels subject to observer coverage to provide adequate and safe conditions for carrying an observer and conditions that allow for operation of normal observer functions. To provide such conditions, a vessel must comply with the applicable regulations regarding observer accommodations (see <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/p229">50 CFR parts 229</ref>, 300, 600, 622, 635, 648, 660, and 679) and possess a current United States Coast Guard (USCG) Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Examination decal or a USCG certificate of examination. A vessel that fails to meet these requirements at the time an observer is to be deployed is prohibited from fishing (<ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s600.746/f">50 CFR 600.746(f)</ref>), unless NMFS determines that an alternative platform (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> a second vessel) may be used or the vessel is not required to take an observer under <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s222.404">50 CFR 222.404</ref>. All fishers on a vessel must cooperate in the operation of observer functions. Observer programs designed or carried out in accordance with <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s222.404">50 CFR 222.404</ref> are consistent with existing NOAA observer policies and applicable federal regulations, such as those under the Fair Labor and Standards Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t29/s201">29 U.S.C. 201</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.</inline>), the Service Contract Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t41/s351">41 U.S.C. 351</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.</inline>), and Observer Health and Safety regulations (<ref href="/us/cfr/t50/p600">50 CFR part 600</ref>).

Existing observer coverage, regardless of the mandate (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> MMPA or MSA) is a consideration when we evaluate any fishery against the AD inclusion criteria. The overlap in seasonal and geographic distribution of sea turtles compared to the existing observation protocol for a given fishery, will help us to determine if the existing observer coverage is adequate to observe sea turtle interactions. It is possible that a Category I fishery is observed for marine mammals, but the existing observations are not sufficient to collect information on sea turtle interactions in a given season or geographic area. In this case inclusion of the fishery on the AD may be warranted to specifically expand coverage to times and areas when sea turtles may overlap with fishing effort. If the opposite is true, and coverage is sufficient for sea turtles, then NMFS may determine that inclusion on the AD is not warranted.

This concern was based on several factors including that the Maryland coastal fishing fleet, which is part of the mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery, is small in scale and consists of some small gillnet vessels operating solely in state waters and state-managed fisheries. Small vessels would be unable to carry additional safety gear, observer personnel and their equipment, and many vessels would not meet the safety requirements for observer coverage. Additionally, MD DNR commented that the Code of Federal Regulations, <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s222.404/b">50 CFR 222.404(b)</ref>, indicates that small vessels can receive an exemption if the facilities are too small for performing observer duties or are inadequate. They requested clarification on the process and criteria for requesting an exemption and the criteria for determining whether a vessel is unsafe for an observer.

NMFS recognizes that state-permitted vessels, particularly those operating in coastal or inshore areas, are often smaller, but that does not preclude the need to observe bycatch in those fisheries. Vessel size is a consideration when developing any observer sampling protocol. When developing an observer program, NMFS would consider the size of the vessels in the fleet to help determine the most appropriate approach for observing the fishery. NMFS observer programs have successfully observed small vessels that operate in inshore gillnet fisheries in the past, and would apply similar considerations to small state-permitted vessels that operate as part of the mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery. In many cases, small vessels have been able to accommodate the addition of an observer for day trips, as long as the vessel meets the USCG safety standards that are required. Alternatively, NMFS may be able to observe through alternative platforms, where the observer is located on a separate vessel, if vessel size and safety are factors for a particular sector of this, or any other, fishery. Additionally, electronic monitoring technology may also be an <?page num="21741"?>option for smaller vessels in a gillnet fishery.

Days are allocated in proportion to fishing effort by time/area, and sampling protocols account for all observer authorities, including MSA, MMPA, and the ESA. All three authorities may be used for a single trip to minimize duplication. Above, we identified the standards NMFS will follow for distributing and placing observers among fisheries identified in the AD and among vessels in those fisheries. These standards include the need to minimize costs and avoid duplication, where practicable. In designing a study, NMFS would identify the pool of vessels that may be observed and consider all the authorities under which these vessels may be observed.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS would also like to clarify that the universe of commercial fisheries considered for the AD (<ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s222.402">50 CFR 222.402</ref>) is based on the MMPA LOF. If the LOF defines a fishery based on broad gear type, NMFS must use that broad gear type on the AD. The LOF defines the scope and geographic area of the mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery, and under the AD, we are unable to isolate specific sections of the fishery for inclusion or exclusion. NMFS must annually reexamine the LOF and provide the opportunity for public comment. NMFS will consider any proposals for changes to the LOF submitted during the annual public comment process. However, even without changes to the LOF, NMFS may determine that only portions of a fishery will be observed using AD authority. For example, while NMFS has decided to include the mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery on the 2018 AD, NMFS is most interested in increasing coverage in nearshore coastal waters of the mid-Atlantic and Delaware Bay.

NMFS would like to provide general clarification on the two questions posed by the commenter. Observer protocols provide clear guidance to the observer on how to classify an interaction and what information to record. At times, the observer is unable to determine the condition (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> alive, fresh dead, moderately decomposed) of the animal. For example, when observing gillnet fisheries, the observer may be able to see that there is a turtle in the gillnet, but when the gillnet is hauled back the animal falls out of the net before the observer is able to assess the animal. In this instance, the interaction may be recorded as condition unknown. The animal may also not be identified to species.

Rather, the latter is determined during the post-interaction mortality determination, which considers the type of gear (mobile or fixed). For mobile gears, moderately and severely decomposed animals are not typically attributed to the haul on which they were caught and, thus, are not attributed to that fishery. For fixed gear, NMFS further evaluates the animal and its capture conditions, considering factors such as but not limited to the animal's condition, water temperature, and soak times to determine if the animal's death was related to the fishery interaction.

The mid-<?page num="21743"?>Atlantic gillnet fishery was not listed in the 2015 AD, but the Chesapeake Bay inshore gillnet fishery and Long Island inshore gillnet fishery were. By including the mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery in the 2018 AD, we authorize observer coverage more completely in the mid-Atlantic region. The mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery (estimated 3,950 vessels/persons) targets monkfish, spiny dogfish, smooth dogfish, bluefish, weakfish, menhaden, spot, croaker, striped bass, large and small coastal sharks, Spanish mackerel, king mackerel, American shad, black drum, skate spp., yellow perch, white perch, herring, scup, kingfish, spotted seatrout, and butterfish. The fishery uses drift and sink gillnets, including nets set in a sink, stab, set, strike, or drift fashion, with some unanchored drift or sink nets used to target specific species. The dominant material is monofilament twine with stretched mesh sizes from 2.5–12 in. (6.4–30.5 cm), and string lengths from 150–8,400 feet (ft) (46–2,560 meter (m)). This fishery operates year-round west of a line drawn at 72°30′ W long. south to 36°33.03′ N lat. and east to the eastern edge of the EEZ and north of the North Carolina/South Carolina border, not including Category II and III inshore gillnet fisheries (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> Chesapeake Bay, North Carolina, Long Island Sound inshore gillnet, Delaware River inshore gillnet, Rhode Island, southern Massachusetts (to Monomoy Island), and New York Bight (Raritan and Lower NY Bays) inshore gillnet fisheries). This fishery includes any residual large pelagic driftnet effort in the mid-Atlantic and any shark and dogfish gillnet effort in the mid-Atlantic zone described. The fishing occurs right off the beach (6 ft. (1.8 m)) or in nearshore coastal waters to offshore waters (250 ft. (76 m)).

The Gulf of Mexico menhaden purse seine fishery (estimated 40–42 vessels/persons) targets menhaden. The fishery uses purse seine gear and operates in bays, sounds, and nearshore coastal waters along the Gulf of Mexico coast. The majority of fishing effort occurs in Louisiana and Mississippi, with lesser effort in Alabama and Texas state waters. Florida prohibits the use of purse seines in state waters. The fishery is state-managed, with planning efforts coordinated under the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission Interstate Gulf Menhaden Fishery Management Plan.

Sea turtle strandings in the northern Gulf of Mexico have been documented during times and in areas near where the menhaden fishery operates. The fishery was observed in the early-1990s by Louisiana State University. In 2011, NMFS conducted a pilot observer program in this fishery to better understand the fishery's operations and evaluate the feasibility of observing for marine mammal and sea turtle bycatch. During the pilot observer program, two sea turtles were documented, one dead Kemp's ridley that was excluded by the large fish excluder and one live unidentified turtle that was successfully released from the purse-seine net. Future observer efforts will build on the information obtained in 2011.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Atlantic shark fisheries are managed under the 2006 Consolidated Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP), its amendments, and implementing regulations (<ref href="/us/cfr/t50/p635">50 CFR part 635</ref>) issued under authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t16/s1801">16 U.S.C. 1801</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.</inline>).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under § 635.24(a)(8), NMFS may adjust the commercial retention limit in the shark fisheries during the fishing season. Before making any adjustment, NMFS must consider specified regulatory criteria and other relevant factors See § 635.24(a)(8)(i)–(vi). After considering these criteria as discussed below, we have concluded that reducing the retention limit of the Atlantic aggregated LCS and hammerhead management groups for directed shark limited access permit holders will slow the fishery catch rates to allow the fishery throughout the Atlantic region to remain open for the rest of the year. Since landings have reached approximately 20 percent of the quota and are projected to reach 80 percent before the end of the 2018 fishing season, NMFS is reducing the commercial Atlantic aggregated LCS and hammerhead shark retention limit from 25 to 3 LCS other than sandbar per vessel per trip.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS considered whether to reduce the retention limit for LCS other than sandbar sharks, considering the inseason retention limit adjustment criteria listed in § 635.24(a)(8), which includes (broken down by bullet points):
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• The amount of remaining shark quota in the relevant area, region, or sub-region, to date, based on dealer reports.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Based on dealer reports, 32.7 mt dw or 19 percent of the 168.9 mt dw shark quota for the aggregated LCS management group has already been landed in the Atlantic region. This means that approximately 80 percent of the quota remains. At current landings rates, this quota would be expanded by July. These levels this early in the season indicate that unless action is taken to slow landings, fishermen in the Atlantic region may not have an opportunity to fish in the region for the remainder of the year.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• The catch rates of the relevant shark species/complexes in the region or sub-region, to date, based on dealer reports.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Dealer reports indicate a high level of average daily landings. At this level, aggregated LCS are being harvested too quickly to ensure fishing opportunities throughout the season. If the per trip limit is left unchanged, aggregated LCS would likely be harvested at such a high rate that there would not be enough aggregated LCS quota remaining to keep the fishery open year-round, precluding equitable fishing opportunities for the entire Atlantic region.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Estimated date of fishery closure based on when the landings are projected to reach 80 percent of the quota given the realized catch rates.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Once the landings reach 80 percent of the quota, NMFS would have to close the aggregated LCS management group as well as the “linked hammerhead shark management group. Current catch rates would likely result in reaching this limit by the beginning of July. A closure so early in the year would preclude fishing opportunities in the Atlantic region for the remainder of the year.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Effects of the adjustment on accomplishing the objectives of the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP and its amendments.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Reducing the retention limit for the aggregated LCS and hammerhead management group from 25 to 3 LCS per trip would allow for fishing opportunities later in the year consistent with the FMP's objectives to ensure equitable fishing opportunities throughout the fishing season and to limit bycatch and discards.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Variations in seasonal distribution, abundance, or migratory patterns of the relevant shark species based on scientific and fishery-based knowledge.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The directed shark fisheries in the Atlantic region exhibit a mixed species composition, with a high abundance of aggregated LCS caught in conjunction with hammerhead sharks. As a result, by slowing the harvest and reducing landings on a per-trip basis, both <?page num="21745"?>fisheries could remain open for the remainder of the year.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Effects of catch rates in one part of a region or sub-region precluding vessels in another part of that region or sub-region from having a reasonable opportunity to harvest a portion of the relevant quota.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Based on dealer reports, and given NMFS' notice to the regulated community (<ref href="/us/fr/82/55512">82 FR 55512</ref>, <date date="2017-11-22">November 22, 2017</date>) that a goal of this year's fishery was to ensure fishing opportunities throughout the fishing season, NMFS has concluded that the aggregated LCS quota is being harvested too quickly to meet conservation and management goals for the fishery. If the harvest of these species is not slowed, we estimate that the fishery would close by the beginning of July. Closing the fishery so early would prevent fishermen from other parts of the Atlantic region from having the same opportunities to harvest the aggregated LCS quota later in the year.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2017-11-22">November 22, 2017</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/82/55512">82 FR 55512</ref>), NMFS announced that the aggregated LCS and hammerhead shark management groups for the Atlantic region would open on January 1 with a quota of 168.9 metric tons (mt) dressed weight (dw) (372,552 lb dw) and 27.1 mt dw (59,736 lb dw), respectively. In that final rule, NMFS also indicated that if it appeared that the aggregated LCS management group quota is being harvested too quickly, to allow fishermen throughout the entire region an opportunity to fish (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> if approximately 20 percent of the quota is caught at the beginning of the year), NMFS would consider reducing the commercial retention limit for LCS other than sandbar sharks. Dealer reports through <date date="2018-05-04">May 4, 2018</date>, indicate that 32.7 mt dw or 19 percent of the available quota for the aggregated LCS management group has been harvested. If the average landings rate for the aggregated LCS management group reflected in the dealer reports continues, landings could reach 80 percent of the quota by the beginning of July. Once the landings reach 80 percent of the quota, NMFS would close both the aggregated LCS and hammerhead management group because they are linked under the regulations (§ 635.28(b)(3)).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Accordingly, as of 11:30 p.m. local time <date date="2018-05-12">May 12, 2018</date>, NMFS is reducing the retention limit for the commercial aggregated LCS and hammerhead shark management groups in the Atlantic region for directed shark limited access permit holders from 25 LCS other than sandbar sharks per vessel per trip to 3 LCS other than sandbar sharks per vessel per trip. If the vessel is properly permitted to operate as a charter vessel or headboat for HMS and is engaged in a for-hire trip, in which case the recreational retention limits for sharks and “no sale” provisions apply (§ 635.22(a) and (c)), or if the vessel possesses a valid shark research permit under § 635.32 and a NMFS-approved observer is onboard, then they are exempted from the retention limit adjustment.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">All other retention limits and shark fisheries in the Atlantic region remain unchanged. This retention limit will remain at 3 LCS other than sandbar sharks per vessel per trip for the rest of the 2018 fishing season, or until NMFS announces via a notice in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> another adjustment to the retention limit or a fishery closure is warranted.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The boundary between the Gulf of Mexico region and the Atlantic region is defined at § 635.27(b)(1) as a line beginning on the East Coast of Florida at the mainland at 25°20.4′ N. lat, proceeding due East. Any water and land to the north and east of that boundary is considered, for the purposes of quota monitoring and setting of quotas, to be within the Atlantic region.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Pursuant to <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)</ref>, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), finds there is good cause to waive prior notice and an opportunity for public comment on this action, as notice and comment would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest. Providing prior notice and an opportunity for comment is impracticable because the catch and landings that need to be reduced are ongoing and must be reduced immediately to meet conservation and management objectives for the fishery. Continued fishing at those levels during the time that notice and comment takes place would result in the much of the quota being landed and could result in a very early closure of the fishery, contrary to the objectives of the existing conservation and management measures in place for those species. These objectives include ensuring that fishing opportunities are equitable and that bycatch and discards are minimized. Allowing fishing to continue at the existing rates even for a limited time is contrary to these objectives and would thus be impracticable. It would also be contrary to the public interest because, if the quota continues to be caught at the current levels, the quota will not last throughout the remainder of the fishing season and a large number of fishermen would be denied the opportunity to land sharks from the quota. Furthermore, continued catch at the current rates, even for a limited period, could result in eventual quota overharvests, since it is still so early in the fishing year. The AA also finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in effective date pursuant to <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/d/3">5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)</ref> for the same reasons. This action is required under § 635.28(b)(2) and is exempt from review under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>. NMFS has concluded that reducing the retention limit of the Atlantic aggregated LCS and hammerhead management groups for directed shark limited access permit holders will slow the fishery catch rates to allow the fishery throughout the Atlantic region to remain open for the rest of the year.

In that NOI, the Commission sought detailed comment on frequency bands that had garnered interest to potentially support increased flexible broadband uses, including the 3.7–4.2 GHz band. While recognizing the existing FSS (space-to-Earth) and Fixed Service (FS) uses of the 3.7–4.2 GHz band, the Commission sought comment on the potential for more intensive use of that band for wireless broadband, including asking how current service rules governing geostationary satellite orbit FSS and FS could be modified to promote flexible use, stimulate investment, and encourage more intensive deployment.

Applicants who file within the 90-day window will otherwise be processed normally. Registrations or licenses granted for applications filed without the coordination report will include a condition noting that the license or registration does not afford interference protection from FS transmissions.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS seeks comments on this proposed rule issued under authority of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention Implementation Act (WCPFC Implementation Act). The proposed rule would implement recent decisions of the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC or Commission). These decisions include the following management measures: limits on fishing effort by U.S. purse seine vessels in the U.S. exclusive economic zone and on the high seas between the latitudes of 20° N and 20° S in the area of application of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Convention); restrictions regarding the use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) for U.S. purse seine fishing vessels; limits on the catches of bigeye tuna by U.S. longline vessels in the Convention area; prohibitions on U.S. vessels used to fish for highly migratory species from engaging in transshipment in a particular area of the high seas (the Eastern High Seas Special Management Area or EHSSMA); and removal of existing reporting requirements for vessels transiting the EHSSMA. The rule also would make corrections to outdated cross references in existing regulatory text. This action is necessary to satisfy the obligations of the United States under the Convention, to which it is a Contracting Party.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Background on the Convention
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Convention focused on the conservation and management of fisheries for highly migratory species (HMS). The objective of the Convention is to ensure, through effective management, the long-term conservation and sustainable use of HMS in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO). To accomplish this objective, the Convention established the Commission, which includes Members, Cooperating Non-members, and Participating Territories (collectively referred to here as “members”). The United States of America is a Member. American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) are Participating Territories.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As a Contracting Party to the Convention and a Member of the Commission, the United States implements, as appropriate, conservation and management measures and other decisions adopted by the Commission. The WCPFC Implementation Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t16/s6901">16 U.S.C. 6901</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.</inline>), authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Department in which the United States Coast Guard is operating (currently the Department of Homeland Security), to promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the obligations of the United States under the Convention, including the decisions of the Commission. The WCPFC Implementation Act further provides that the Secretary of Commerce shall ensure consistency, to the extent practicable, of fishery management programs administered under the WCPFC Implementation Act and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA; <ref href="/us/usc/t16/s1801">16 U.S.C. 1801</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.</inline>), as well as other specific laws (see <ref href="/us/usc/t16/s6905/b">16 U.S.C. 6905(b)</ref>). The Secretary of Commerce has delegated the authority to promulgate regulations under the WCPFC Implementation Act to NMFS. A map showing the boundaries of the area of application of the Convention (Convention Area), which comprises the majority of the WCPO, can be found on the WCPFC website at: <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">www.wcpfc.int/doc/convention-area-map.</inline>

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Background on the Conservation and Management Measures
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This proposed rule would implement specific provisions of two recent WCPFC decisions. The first decision, Conservation and Management Measure (CMM) 2017–01, “Conservation and Management Measure for Bigeye, <?page num="21749"?>Yellowfin, and Skipjack Tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean,” was adopted by the Commission at its fourteenth regular annual session, in December 2017, and went into effect February 2018. The provisions of CMM 2017–01 are described in more detail below. The second decision, CMM 2016–02, “Conservation and Management Measures for Eastern High Seas Pocket Special Management Area,” revises a previous measure regarding the EHSSMA so that vessels are no longer required to provide reports to the Commission when entering and exiting the EHSSMA and also prohibits all transshipment activities in the area starting on <date date="2019-01-01">January 1, 2019</date>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">CMM 2017–01 is the latest in a series of CMMs devoted to the conservation and management of tropical tuna stocks, particularly stocks of bigeye tuna (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Thunnus obesus</inline>), yellowfin tuna (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Thunnus albacares</inline>), and skipjack tuna (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Katsuwonus pelamis</inline>). The stated purpose of CMM 2017–01 is to provide for a robust transitional management regime that ensures the sustainability of bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and skipjack tuna in the WCPO pending the Commission's establishment of harvest strategies.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In order to achieve that stated purpose, CMM 2017–01 includes provisions for longline and purse seine vessels that would be implemented in this proposed rule. For longline vessels, the CMM includes specific bigeye tuna catch limits for several WCPFC members, including the United States. The CMM provides for a limit of 3,554 metric tons (mt) of bigeye tuna that may be caught by U.S. longline vessels fishing in the Convention Area for calendar year 2018, which is the same as the U.S. limit in 2016, as specified in earlier WCPFC decisions. As in previous WCPFC CMMs on tropical tunas, CMM 2017–01 also requires any overage of the catch limit to be deducted from the following year's limit.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Also as in previous CMMs, no limits apply to the longline fisheries of the U.S. Participating Territories of American Samoa, Guam, and CNMI. In addition, CMM 2017–01 includes a new provision for U.S. longline vessels, stating that catch and effort of U.S.-flagged vessels operating under agreements with the U.S. Participating Territories shall be attributed to the U.S. Participating Territories.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For purse seine vessels, CMM 2017–01 includes several restrictions on the use of FADs and provides for specific limits on fishing effort.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The first FAD restriction is similar to the one included in previous WCPFC decisions and requires purse seine vessels to be prohibited from fishing on FADs on the high seas and in the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the Convention Area between the latitudes of 20° N and 20° S from July 1 through September 30 of 2018. The second FAD restriction requires WCPFC members to establish an additional consecutive two-month FAD prohibition period on the high seas in the Convention Area in 2018, in either April and May or November and December. CMM 2017–01 also includes provisions encouraging WCPFC members to use non-entangling design and materials as well as biodegradable materials in the construction of FADs. Finally, CMM 2017–01 includes a provision requiring that each purse seine vessel have no more than 350 drifting FADs with activated instrumented buoys deployed at sea in the Convention Area at any one time through <date date="2021-02-10">February 10, 2021</date>. Under the CMM, an instrumented buoy is defined as a buoy with a clearly marked reference number allowing its identification and equipped with a satellite tracking system to monitor its position. The CMM states that the buoy shall be activated exclusively on board the vessel.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under CMM 2017–01, WCPFC members must also limit their purse seine vessels to specific fishing effort limits. The limits on U.S. purse seine fishing effort detailed in CMM 2017–01 are similar to limits in previous WCPFC decisions. The limits are 558 fishing days in the U.S. EEZ and 1,270 fishing days on the high seas in the Convention Area between the latitudes of 20° N and 20° S for each of the calendar years 2018–2020. However, CMM 2017–01 also includes a new provision for 2018 only that allows the United States to transfer 100 fishing days from its limit in the U.S. EEZ to its limit on the high seas, and if the U.S. EEZ limit is reached by <date date="2018-10-01">October 1, 2018</date>, the U.S. EEZ limit will be increased by an additional 100 fishing days, with the expectation that the catch taken by U.S. flagged vessels and landed in American Samoa for the American Samoa canneries is no less than the volume landed in 2017 plus an additional 3,500 short tonnes. This new provision was intended to alleviate the economic hardship faced by American Samoa and its canneries when U.S. purse seine fishing limits are reached, resulting in fishery closures.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">CMM 2017–01 also includes provisions for purse seine vessels that were in previous WCPFC decisions and that have been implemented by NMFS in regulations that continue in force. These provisions include requirements for purse seine vessels to retain all catch of bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and skipjack tuna, for observer coverage on purse seine vessels, and for vessel monitoring system requirements for purse seine vessels during the FAD closure periods.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Proposed Action
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The elements of the proposed rule are detailed below. The administrative changes that would be made to correct outdated references in existing regulatory text are described at the end.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As described above, some of the provisions in CMM 2017–01 apply only to calendar year 2018, while others are applicable until <date date="2021-02-10">February 10, 2021</date>. Because the Commission likely will continue to implement similar management measures regarding FADs, purse seine effort limits, and longline bigeye tuna catch limits beyond 2018, and to avoid a lapse in the management of the fishery, NMFS is proposing to implement all of the elements of CMM 2017–01 in this proposed rule under the authority of the WCPFC Implementation Act, <ref href="/us/usc/t16/s6904/a">16 U.S.C. 6904(a)</ref>, so that they will remain effective until they are replaced or amended. Because the Commission developed CMM 2017–01 as generally a three-year conservation and management measure (2018–2020), the supporting analyses for this rule covers a three-year time period, understanding that these analyses would need to be supplemented should the elements of the rule remain effective for more than three years.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Commission-adopted longline bigeye tuna catch limit for the United States for 2018 is 3,554 mt. As stated above, CMM 2017–01 reiterates the provision of earlier CMMs that states that any catch overage in a given year shall be deducted from the catch limit for the following year. The longline bigeye tuna catch limit for the United States in 2017 was 3,138 mt (see Interim Rule; <ref href="/us/fr/82/36341">82 FR 36341</ref>, published <date date="2017-08-04">August 4, 2017</date>). Based on preliminary estimates, NMFS believes that the 2017 limit might have been exceeded, but the amount of the overage, if it occurred, is not yet known. Thus, NMFS is proposing a calendar year catch limit of 3,554 mt that would remain effective until replaced. However, for 2018, it is possible that this limit would be adjusted downward to account for any overage in 2017; the limit would similarly be adjusted downward in future years, should any overages occur. NMFS will determine the exact amount of the overage prior to publication of the final rule and include the exact amount of the 2018 limit in the final rule.

Fishing inside and outside the Convention Area:</inline> To help ensure compliance with the restrictions related to bigeye tuna caught by longline gear in the Convention Area, two additional, related prohibitions would be in effect starting on the effective date of the restrictions and extending through December 31 of the calendar year. First, vessels are prohibited from fishing with longline gear both inside and outside the Convention Area during the same fishing trip, with the exception of a fishing trip that is in progress at the time the announced restrictions go into effect. In that exceptional case, the vessel still must land any bigeye tuna taken in the Convention Area within 14 days of the effective date of the restrictions, as described above. Second, if a vessel is used to fish using longline gear outside the Convention Area and enters the Convention Area at any time during the same fishing trip, the longline gear on the fishing vessel must be stowed in a manner so as not to be readily available for fishing while the vessel is in the Convention Area, specifically, the hooks, branch or dropper lines, and floats used to buoy the mainline must be stowed and not available for immediate use, and any power-operated mainline hauler on deck must be covered in such a manner that it is not readily available for use. These two prohibitions do not apply to the following vessels: (1) Vessels on declared shallow-setting trips pursuant to <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s665.803/a">50 CFR 665.803(a)</ref>; and (2) vessels operating for the purposes of this rule as part of the longline fisheries of American Samoa, Guam, or the CNMI. This second group includes vessels registered for use under valid American Samoa Longline Limited Access Permits and vessels landing their bigeye tuna catch in one of the three U.S. Participating Territories, so long as these vessels conduct fishing activities in accordance with the conditions described above, and vessels included in a specified fishing agreement under <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s665.819/d">50 CFR 665.819(d)</ref>, in accordance with <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s300.224/f/iv">50 CFR 300.224(f)(iv)</ref>.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In accordance with CMM 2017–01, NMFS proposes to establish a FAD prohibition period from July through September in each calendar year in the Convention Area between the latitudes of 20° N and 20° S (inclusive of the EEZs and high seas in the Convention Area). Regarding the additional consecutive two-month FAD prohibition period on the high seas in the Convention Area, after considering the objectives of CMM 2017–01, the expected economic impacts on U.S. fishing operations and the nation as a whole, and expected environmental and other effects, NMFS expects that a high seas FAD prohibition period in November and December may be somewhat more cost-effective than a FAD prohibition period in April and May. For this reason, NMFS is proposing to implement the high seas FAD prohibition period in November and December for each calendar year. We specifically seek public comment on which option is more appropriate. A comparison of the two options' expected direct economic impacts on affected fishing businesses is provided in the RIR.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As currently defined in <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s300.211">50 CFR 300.211</ref>, a FAD is “any artificial or natural floating object, whether anchored or not and whether situated at the water surface or not, that is capable of aggregating fish, as well as any object used for that purpose that is situated on board a vessel or otherwise out of the water. The definition of FAD does not include a vessel.” Under this proposed rule, the regulatory definition of a FAD would not change. Although the definition of a FAD does not include a vessel, the restrictions during the FAD <?page num="21751"?>prohibition periods would include certain activities related to fish that have aggregated in association with a vessel, or drawn by a vessel, as described below.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The prohibitions applicable to these proposed FAD-related measures are in existing regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s300.223/b/1/i">50 CFR 300.223(b)(1)(i)</ref>–(v). Specifically, during the July-September FAD prohibition periods in each calendar year, and on the high seas in November and December, owners, operators, and crew of fishing vessels of the United States equipped with purse seine gear shall not do any of the following activities in the Convention Area in the area between 20° N latitude and 20° S latitude:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(1) Set a purse seine around a FAD or within one nautical mile of a FAD;
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(2) Set a purse seine in a manner intended to capture fish that have aggregated in association with a FAD or a vessel, such as by setting the purse seine in an area from which a FAD or a vessel has been moved or removed within the previous eight hours, setting the purse seine in an area in which a FAD has been inspected or handled within the previous eight hours, or setting the purse seine in an area into which fish were drawn by a vessel from the vicinity of a FAD or a vessel;
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(3) Deploy a FAD into the water;
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(4) Repair, clean, maintain, or otherwise service a FAD, including any electronic equipment used in association with a FAD, in the water or on a vessel while at sea, except that a FAD may be inspected and handled as needed to identify the FAD, identify and release incidentally captured animals, un-foul fishing gear, or prevent damage to property or risk to human safety; and a FAD may be removed from the water and if removed may be cleaned, provided that it is not returned to the water.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(5) From a purse seine vessel or any associated skiffs, other watercraft or equipment, submerge lights under water; suspend or hang lights over the side of the purse seine vessel, skiff, watercraft or equipment, or direct or use lights in a manner other than as needed to illuminate the deck of the purse seine vessel or associated skiffs, watercraft or equipment, to comply with navigational requirements, and to ensure the health and safety of the crew. These prohibitions would not apply during emergencies as needed to prevent human injury or the loss of human life, the loss of the purse seine vessel, skiffs, watercraft or aircraft, or environmental damage.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This proposed rule would revise the introductory paragraph of <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s300.223/b/1">50 CFR 300.223(b)(1)</ref> to make it more clear that the prohibitions apply only to owners, operators, and crew of purse seine fishing vessels. NMFS has recently received inquiries as to whether the prohibitions apply to the owners, operators, and crew of vessels using other gear types. This proposed rule would also make a technical change to <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s300.223/b/1/iv/B">50 CFR 300.223(b)(1)(iv)(B)</ref> to clarify that, during the FAD prohibition periods, a FAD may be removed from the water to be repaired, cleaned, maintained, or otherwise serviced, provided that it is not returned to the water. This minor change ensures consistency with the introductory language in that paragraph.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS has recently issued final regulations to implement provisions of a resolution adopted by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) that includes restrictions on the number of FADs with activated instrumented buoys for each purse seine vessel deployed at sea in the IATTC area at any one time (see Final Rule; <ref href="/us/fr/83/15503">83 FR 15503</ref>, published <date date="2018-04-11">April 11, 2018</date>). In order to provide some consistency to the regulated community, NMFS is proposing similar regulations in this rule to implement the limit regarding FADs with activated instrumented buoys specified in CMM 2017–01.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under the proposed rule, an active FAD is defined as a FAD that is equipped with a buoy with a clearly marked reference number allowing its identification and equipped with a satellite tracking system to monitor its position, as specified by the definition of instrumented buoy in CMM 2017–01.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">CMM 2017–01 specifies that the buoy shall be activated exclusively on board the vessel. In order to implement this provision, the proposed rule specifies that the tracking equipment must be turned on while the FAD is onboard the vessel and before it is deployed in the water. In accordance with CMM 2017–01, under the proposed rule, each U.S. purse seine vessel would have a limit of 350 active drifting FADs in the Convention Area at any one time.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Purse Seine Fishing Effort Limits
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the past, NMFS has implemented the U.S. purse seine fishing effort limits on the high seas and in the U.S. EEZ adopted by the Commission as a single combined limit in a combined area of the high seas and U.S. EEZ termed the Effort Limit Area for Purse Seine or ELAPS. NMFS' reasoning for combining the high seas and U.S. EEZ limits was that it afforded more operational flexibility to the fleet and there are no substantial differences in terms of effects to living marine resources for treating the two areas separately or combined so long as the overall effort remained equal or less than the sum of the two limits. For this proposed rule, in light of CMM 2017–01's provision allowing the United States to transfer some of its EEZ days to the high seas, there is a need to separately account for the U.S. high seas limit and the U.S. EEZ limit. Thus, NMFS will no longer combine the two limits under a single limit. As stated above, CMM 2017–01 specifies a limit of 1,270 fishing days per year for the high seas and a limit of 558 fishing days per year for the U.S. EEZ. The proposed rule would establish a limit of 1,370 fishing days on the high seas and a separate limit of 458 fishing days in the U.S. EEZ. These numbers utilize the provision of CMM 2017–01 provided to alleviate the economic hardship experienced by American Samoa during a fishery closure and transfer 100 fishing days from the U.S. EEZ effort limit to the high seas effort limit.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">CMM 2017–01 also specifies that the United States may add an additional 100 fishing days to its annual purse seine fishing effort limit in the U.S. EEZ if the limit in the U.S. EEZ is reached by <date date="2018-10-01">October 1, 2018</date>. As discussed above, NMFS is proposing to to implement the elements of the rule so they are effective until they are amended or replaced. Thus, under the proposed rule, when NMFS expects that the U.S. EEZ effort limit would be reached by October 1, NMFS would publish a notice in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>, no later than seven days prior to October 1, to increase the U.S. EEZ effort limit by 100 fishing days for that calendar year.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS will monitor the number of fishing days spent in the U.S. EEZ and on the high seas using data submitted in logbooks and other available information. If and when NMFS determines that a limit is expected to be reached by a specific future date, it will publish a notice in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> announcing that the purse seine fishery in the area where the limit is expected to be reached will be closed starting on a specific future date and will remain closed until the end of the calendar year. NMFS will publish that notice at least seven days in advance of the closure date. Starting on the announced closure date, and for the remainder of <?page num="21752"?>calendar year, it will be prohibited for U.S. purse seine vessels to fish in the area where the limit is expected to be reached, except that such vessels would not be prohibited from bunkering (refueling) during a fishery closure. NMFS published an interim rule on <date date="2015-08-25">August 25, 2015</date> (see <ref href="/us/fr/80/51478">80 FR 51478</ref>) to remove the restriction that prohibited U.S. purse seine vessels from conducting bunkering during fishery closures of the ELAPS. NMFS is proposing to continue those regulations as part of this proposed rule so that bunkering would be allowed during any fishery closures of the U.S. EEZ or high seas due to reaching a limit in a given calendar year.

NMFS promulgated this regulation to help track a limit on the number of FAD sets that was applicable in previous years but recognizes that this information is also valuable to help predict when a fishing effort limit is expected to be reached with greater certainty. Thus, under this proposed rule, NMFS would revise the existing regulations so that NMFS can direct U.S. purse seine vessel owners and operators to provide reports on the fishing activity of the vessel (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> setting, transiting, searching), location, and type of set, in order to obtain better data for tracking the fishing effort limits.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For Regulatory Flexibility Act purposes only, NMFS has established a small business size standard for businesses, including their affiliates, whose primary industry is commercial fishing (see <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s200.2">50 CFR 200.2</ref>). A business primarily engaged in commercial fishing (NAICS code 114111) is classified as a small business if it is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in its field of operation (including its affiliates), and has combined annual receipts not in excess of $11 million for all its affiliated operations worldwide.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed rule would apply to owners and operators of U.S. commercial fishing vessels used to fish for HMS in the Convention Area, including longline vessels (except those operating as part of the longline fisheries of American Samoa, CNMI, or Guam), purse seine vessels, and albacore troll vessels. Based on the number of U.S. vessels with WCPFC Area Endorsements, which are required to fish on the high seas in the Convention Area, the estimated numbers of affected longline, purse seine, and albacore troll fishing vessels is 163, 37, and 20, respectively.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Based on limited financial information about the affected fishing fleets, and using individual vessels as proxies for individual businesses, NMFS believes that all of the affected longline and albacore troll vessels, and slightly more than half of the vessels in the purse seine fleet, are small entities as defined by the RFA; that is, they are independently owned and operated and not dominant in their fields of operation, and have annual receipts of no more than $11.0 million. Within the purse seine fleet, analysis of average revenue, by vessel, for the three years of 2014–2016 reveals that average annual revenue among vessels in the fleet was about $10.2 million, and the three-year annual averages were less than the $11 million threshold for 22 vessels in the fleet.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements of this proposed rule are described earlier in the preamble. The classes of small entities subject to the requirements and <?page num="21753"?>the types of professional skills necessary to fulfill the requirements are described below for each of the first four elements of the proposed rule. The fifth element, administrative changes to existing regulations, is not considered further in this IRFA because it would be of a housekeeping nature and not have any substantive effects on any entities.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This element of the proposed rule would not establish any new reporting or recordkeeping requirements. The new compliance requirement would be for affected vessel owners and operators to cease retaining, landing, and transshipping bigeye tuna caught with longline gear in the Convention Area if and when the bigeye tuna catch limit of 3,554 mt (reduced by the amount of any overages in the preceding year) is reached in any of the years 2018–2020, for the remainder of the calendar year, subject to the exceptions and provisos described in other sections of this <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-2">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</inline> section of the preamble. Although the restrictions that would come into effect in the event the catch limit is reached would not prohibit longline fishing, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">per se,</inline> they are sometimes referred to in this analysis as constituting a fishery closure.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Fulfillment of this requirement is not expected to require any professional skills that the vessel owners and operators do not already possess. The costs of complying with this requirement are described below to the extent possible.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Complying with this element of the proposed rule could cause foregone fishing opportunities and result in associated economic losses in the event that the bigeye tuna catch limit is reached in any of the years 2018–2020 and the restrictions on retaining, landing, and transshipping bigeye tuna are imposed for portions of those years. These costs cannot be projected quantitatively with any certainty. The proposed annual limit of 3,554 mt can be compared to catches in 2005–2008, before limits were in place. The average annual catch in that period was 4,709 mt. Based on that history, as well as fishing patterns in 2009–2016, when limits were in place, there appears to be a relatively high likelihood of the proposed limits being reached in 2018–2020. In 2015, for example, which saw exceptionally high catches of bigeye tuna, the limit of 3,502 mt was estimated to have been reached by, and the fishery was closed on, August 5 (see temporary rule published <date date="2015-07-28">July 28, 2015</date>; <ref href="/us/fr/80/44883">80 FR 44883</ref>). The fishery was subsequently re-opened for vessels included in agreements with the governments of the CNMI and Guam under regulations implementing Amendment 7 to the Fishery Ecosystem Plan for Pelagic Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region (Pelagics FEP) (<ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s665.819">50 CFR 665.819</ref>). In 2016, the limit of 3,554 mt was estimated to have been reached by <date date="2016-09-09">September 9, 2016</date>, and in 2017, the limit of 3,138 mt was estimated to have been reached by <date date="2017-09-01">September 1, 2017</date>. Thus, if bigeye tuna catch patterns in 2018–2020 are like those in 2005–2008, the limit would be reached in the fourth quarter of the year, and if they are like those in 2015, 2016, or 2017, the limit would be reached in the third quarter of the year.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">If the bigeye tuna limit is reached before the end of any of the years 2018–2020 and the Convention Area longline bigeye tuna fishery is consequently closed for the remainder of the calendar year, it can be expected that affected vessels would shift to the next most profitable fishing opportunity (which might be not fishing at all). Revenues from that next best alternative activity reflect the opportunity costs associated with longline fishing for bigeye tuna in the Convention Area. The economic cost of the proposed rule would not be the direct losses in revenues that would result from not being able to fish for bigeye tuna in the Convention Area, but rather the difference in benefits derived from that activity and those derived from the next best activity. The economic cost of the proposed rule on affected entities is examined here by first estimating the direct losses in revenues that would result from not being able to fish for bigeye tuna in the Convention Area as a result of the catch limit being reached. Those losses represent the upper bound of the economic cost of the proposed rule on affected entities. Potential next-best alternative activities that affected entities could undertake are then identified in order to provide a (mostly qualitative) description of the degree to which actual costs would be lower than that upper bound.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Upper bounds on potential economic costs can be estimated by examining the projected value of longline landings from the Convention Area that would not be made as a result of reaching the limit. For this purpose, it is assumed that, absent this proposed rule, bigeye tuna catches in the Convention Area in each of the years 2018–2020 would be 5,000 mt, slightly more than the average in 2005–2008. Under this scenario, imposition of annual limits of 3,554 mt would result in 29 percent less bigeye tuna being caught each year than under no action. In the deep-set fishery, catches of marketable species other than bigeye tuna would likely be affected in a similar way if vessels do not shift to alternative activities. Assuming for the moment that ex-vessel prices would not be affected by a fishery closure, under the proposed rule, revenues in 2018–2020 to entities that participate exclusively in the deep-set fishery would be approximately 29 percent less than under no action. Average annual ex-vessel revenues (from all species) per mt of bigeye tuna caught during 2005–2008 were about $14,190/mt (in 2014 dollars, derived from the latest available annual report on the pelagic fisheries of the western Pacific Region (Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, 2014, Pelagic Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region: 2012 Annual Report. Honolulu, Western Pacific Fishery Management Council)). If there are 128 active vessels in the fleet, as there were during 2005–2008, on average, then under the no-action scenario of fleet-wide anual catches of 5,000 mt, each vessel would catch 39 mt/yr, on average. Reductions of 29 percent in 2018–2020 as a result of the proposed limits would be about 11 mt per year. Applying the average ex-vessel revenues (from all species) of $14,190 per mt of bigeye tuna caught, the reductions in ex-vessel revenue per vessel would be $160,000 per year, on average.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the shallow-set fishery, affected entities would bear limited costs in the event of the limit being reached (but most affected entities also participate in the deep-set fishery and might bear costs in that fishery, as described below). The cost would be about equal to the revenues lost from not being able to retain or land bigeye tuna captured while shallow-setting in the Convention Area, or the cost of shifting to shallow-setting in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO), which is to the east of 150 degrees W longitude, whichever is less. In the fourth calendar quarters of 2005–2008, almost all shallow-setting effort took place in the EPO, and 97 percent of bigeye tuna catches were made there, so the cost of a bigeye tuna fishery closure to shallow-setting vessels would appear to be very limited. During 2005–2008, the shallow-set fishery caught an average of 54 mt of bigeye tuna per year from the Convention Area. If the proposed bigeye tuna catch limit is reached even as early as July 31 in any of the years 2018–2020, the Convention Area shallow-set fishery would have caught at that point, based on 2005–2008 data, on average, 99 percent of its average annual bigeye tuna catches. Imposition of the landings restriction at <?page num="21754"?>that point in any of the years 2018–2020 would result in the loss of revenues from approximately 0.5 mt (1 percent of 54 mt) of bigeye tuna, which, based on recent ex-vessel prices, would be worth no more than $5,000. Thus, expecting about 27 vessels to engage in the shallow-set fishery (the annual average in 2005–2012), the average of those potentially lost annual revenues would be no more than $200 per vessel. The remainder of this analysis focuses on the potential costs of compliance in the deep-set fishery.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">It should be noted that the impacts on affected entities' profits would be less than impacts on revenues when considering the costs of operating vessels, because costs would be lower if a vessel ceases fishing after the catch limit is reached. Variable costs can be expected to be affected roughly in proportion to revenues, as both variable costs and revenues would stop accruing once a vessel stops fishing. But affected entities' costs also include fixed costs, which are borne regardless of whether a vessel is used to fish—<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> if it is tied up at the dock during a fishery closure. Thus, profits would likely be adversely impacted proportionately more than revenues.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As stated previously, actual compliance costs for a given entity might be less than the upper bounds described above, because ceasing fishing would not necessarily be the most profitable alternative opportunity when the catch limit is reached. Two alternative opportunities that are expected to be attractive to affected entities include: (1) Deep-set longline fishing for bigeye tuna in the Convention Area in a manner such that the vessel is considered part of the longline fishery of American Samoa, Guam, or the CNMI; and (2) deep-set longline fishing for bigeye tuna and other species in the EPO. These two opportunities are discussed in detail below. Four additional opportunities are: (3) Shallow-set longline fishing for swordfish (for deep-setting vessels that would not otherwise do so), (4) deep-set longline fishing in the Convention Area for species other than bigeye tuna, (5) working in cooperation with vessels operating as part of the longline fisheries of the Participating Territories—specifically, receiving transshipments at sea from them and delivering the fish to the Hawaii market, and (6) vessel repair and maintenance. A study by NMFS of the effects of the WCPO bigeye tuna longline fishery closure in 2010 (Richmond, L., D. Kotowicz, J. Hospital and S. Allen, 2015, Monitoring socioeconomic impacts of Hawai`i's 2010 bigeye tuna closure: Complexities of local management in a global fishery, Ocean &amp; Coastal Management 106:87–96) did not identify the occurrence of any alternative activities that vessels engaged in during the closure, other than deep-setting for bigeye tuna in the EPO, vessel maintenance and repairs, and granting lengthy vacations to employees. Based on those findings, NMFS expects that alternative opportunities (3), (4), (5) and (6) are probably unattractive relative to the first two alternatives, and are not discussed here in any further detail. NMFS recognizes that vessel maintenance and repairs and granting lengthy vacations to employees are two alternative activities that might be taken advantage of if the fishery is closed, but no further analysis of their mitigating effects is provided here.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Before examining in detail the two potential alternative fishing opportunities that would appear to be the most attractive to affected entities, it is important to note that under the proposed rule, once the limit is reached and the WCPO bigeye tuna fishery is closed, fishing with longline gear both inside and outside the Convention Area during the same trip would be prohibited (except in the case of a fishing trip that is in progress when the limit is reached and the restrictions go into effect). For example, after the restrictions go into effect, during a given fishing trip, a vessel could be used for longline fishing for bigeye tuna in the EPO or for longline fishing for species other than bigeye tuna in the Convention Area, but not for both. This reduced operational flexibility would bring costs, because it would constrain the potential profits from alternative opportunities. Those costs cannot be quantified.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A vessel could take advantage of the first alternative opportunity (deep-setting for bigeye tuna in a manner such that the vessel is considered part of the longline fishery of one of the three U.S. Participating Territories), by three possible methods: (a) Landing the bigeye tuna in one of the three Participating Territories, (b) holding an American Samoa Longline Limited Access Permit, or (c) being considered part of a Participating Territory's longline fishery, by agreement with one or more of the three Participating Territories under the regulations implementing Amendment 7 to the Pelagics FEP (<ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s665.819">50 CFR 665.819</ref>). In the first two circumstances, the vessel would be considered part of the longline fishery of the Participating Territory only if the bigeye tuna were not caught in the portion of the U.S. EEZ around the Hawaiian Islands and were landed by a U.S. vessel operating in compliance with a permit issued under the regulations implementing the Pelagics FEP or the Fishery Management Plan for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">With respect to the first method of engaging in alternative opportunity 1 (1.a.) (landing the bigeye tuna in one of the Participating Territories), there are three potentially important constraints. First, whether the fish are landed by the vessel that caught the fish or by a vessel to which the fish were transshipped, the costs of a vessel transiting from the traditional fishing grounds in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Archipelago to one of the Participating Territories would be substantial. Second, none of these three locales has large local consumer markets to absorb substantial additional landings of fresh sashimi-grade bigeye tuna. Third, transporting the bigeye tuna from these locales to larger markets, such as markets in Hawaii, the U.S. west coast, or Japan, would bring substantial additional costs and risks. These cost constraints suggest that this alternative opportunity has limited potential to mitigate the economic impacts of the proposed rule on affected small entities.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The second method of engaging in the first alternative opportunity (1.b.) (having an American Samoa Longline Limited Access Permit), would be available only to the subset of the Hawaii longline fleet that has both Hawaii and American Samoa longline permits (dual permit vessels). Vessels that do not have both permits could obtain them if they meet the eligibility requirements and pay the required costs. For example, the number of dual permit vessels increased from 12 in 2009, when the first WCPO bigeye tuna catch limit was established, to 23 in 2016. The previously cited NMFS study of the 2010 fishery closure (Richmond <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2015) found that bigeye tuna landings of dual permit vessels increased substantially after the start of the closure on <date date="2010-11-22">November 22, 2010</date>, indicating that this was an attractive opportunity for dual permit vessels, and suggesting that those entities might have benefitted from the catch limit and the closure.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The third method of engaging in the first alternative opportunity (1.c.) (entering into an Amendment 7 agreement), was also available in 2011–2017 (in 2011–2013, under <ref href="/us/pl/112/55/s113/a">section 113(a) of Public Law 112–55</ref>, <ref href="/us/stat/125/552">125 Stat. 552</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.,</inline> the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, continued by <ref href="/us/pl/113/6">Public Law 113–6</ref>, <ref href="/us/stat/125/603">125 Stat. 603</ref>, section 110, the <?page num="21755"?>Department of Commerce Appropriations Act, 2013; hereafter, “section 113(a)”). As a result of agreements that were in place in 2011–2014, the WCPO bigeye tuna fishery was not closed in any of those years. In 2015, 2016, and 2017 the fishery was closed but then reopened when agreements went into effect. Participation in an Amendment 7 agreement would likely not come without costs to fishing businesses. As an indication of the possible cost, the terms of the agreement between American Samoa and the members of the Hawaii Longline Association (HLA) in effect in 2011 and 2012 included payments totaling $250,000 from the HLA to the Western Pacific Sustainable Fisheries Fund, equal to $2,000 per vessel. It is not known how the total cost was allocated among the members of the HLA, so it is possible that the owners of particular vessels paid substantially more than or less than $2,000.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The second alternative opportunity (2) (deep-set fishing for bigeye tuna in the EPO), would be an option for affected entities only if it is allowed under regulations implementing the decisions of the IATTC. NMFS has issued a final rule to implement the IATTC's most recent resolution on the management of tropical tuna stocks (<ref href="/us/fr/83/15503">83 FR 15503</ref>; <date date="2018-04-11">April 11, 2018</date>). The final rule establishes an annual limit of 750 mt on the catch of bigeye tuna in the EPO by vessels at least 24m in length in each of the years 2018–2020. Annual longline bigeye tuna catch limits have been in place for the EPO in most years since 2004. Since 2009, when the limit was 500 mt, it was reached in 2013 (November 11), 2014 (October 31), and 2015 (August 12). In 2016 NMFS forecasted that the limit would be reached July 25 and subsequently closed the fishery, but later determined that the catch limit had not been reached and re-opened the fishery on <date date="2016-10-04">October 4, 2016</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/81/69717">81 FR 69717</ref>). The limit was not reached in 2017.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The highly seasonal nature of bigeye tuna catches in the EPO and the relatively high inter-annual variation in catches prevents NMFS from making a useful prediction of whether and when the EPO limits in 2018–2020 are likely to be reached. If it is reached, this alternative opportunity would not be available for large longline vessels, which constitute about a quarter of the fleet.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Historical fishing patterns can provide an indication of the likelihood of affected entities making use of the opportunity of deep-setting in the EPO in the event of a closure in the WCPO. The proportion of the U.S. fishery's annual bigeye tuna catches that were captured in the EPO from 2005 through 2008 ranged from 2 percent to 22 percent, and averaged 11 percent. In 2005–2007, that proportion ranged from 2 percent to 11 percent, and may have been constrained by the IATTC-adoped bigeye tuna catch limits established by NMFS (no limit was in place for 2008). Prior to 2009, most of the U.S. annual bigeye tuna catch by longline vessels in the EPO typically was made in the second and third quarters of the year; in 2005–2008 the percentages caught in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters were 14, 33, 50, and 3 percent, respectively. These data demonstrate two historical patterns—that relatively little of the bigeye tuna catch in the longline fishery was typically taken in the EPO (11 percent in 2005–2008, on average), and that most EPO bigeye tuna catches were made in the second and third quarters, with relatively few catches in the fourth quarter when the proposed catch limit would most likely be reached. These two patterns suggest that there could be substantial costs for at least some affected entities that shift to deep-set fishing in the EPO in the event of a closure in the WCPO. On the other hand, fishing patterns since 2008 suggest that a substantial shift in deep-set fishing effort to the EPO could occur. In 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 the proportions of the fishery's annual bigeye tuna catches that were captured in the EPO were about 16, 27, 23, 19, 36, 35, 47, and 36 percent, respectively, and most bigeye tuna catches in the EPO were made in the latter half of the calendar years.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The NMFS study of the 2010 closure (Richmond <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2015) found that some businesses—particularly those with smaller vessels—were less inclined than others to fish in the EPO during the closure because of the relatively long distances that would need to be travelled in the relatively rough winter ocean conditions. The study identified a number of factors that likely made fishing in the EPO less lucrative than fishing in the WCPO during that part of the year, including fuel costs and the need to limit trip length in order to maintain fish quality and because of limited fuel storage capacity.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition to affecting the volume of landings of bigeye tuna and other species, the proposed catch limits could affect fish prices, particularly during a fishery closure. Both increases and decreases appear possible. After a limit is reached and landings from the WCPO are prohibited, ex-vessel prices of bigeye tuna (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> that are caught in the EPO or by vessels in the longline fisheries of the three U.S. Participating Territories), as well as of other species landed by the fleet, could increase as a result of the constricted supply. This would mitigate economic losses for vessels that are able to continue fishing and landing bigeye tuna during the closure. For example, the NMFS study of the 2010 closure (Richmond <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2015) found that ex-vessel prices during the closure in December were 50 percent greater than the average during the previous five Decembers. (It is emphasized that because it was an observational study, neither this nor other observations of what occurred during the closure can be affirmatively linked as effects of the fishery closure.)
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Conversely, a WCPO bigeye tuna fishery closure could cause a decrease in ex-vessel prices of bigeye tuna and other products landed by affected entities if the interruption in the local supply prompts the Hawaii market to shift to alternative (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> imported) sources of bigeye tuna. Such a shift could be temporary—that is, limited to 2018–2020—or it could lead to a more permanent change in the market (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> as a result of wholesale and retail buyers wanting to mitigate the uncertainty in the continuity of supply from the Hawaii longline fisheries). In the latter case, if locally caught bigeye tuna fetches lower prices because of stiffer competition with imported bigeye tuna, then ex-vessel prices of local product could be depressed indefinitely. The NMFS study of the 2010 closure (Richmond <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.</inline> 2015) found that a common concern in the Hawaii fishing community prior to the closure in November 2010 was retailers having to rely more heavily on imported tuna, causing imports to gain a greater market share in local markets. The study found this not to have been borne out, at least not in 2010, when the evidence gathered in the study suggested that few buyers adapted to the closure by increasing their reliance on imports, and no reports or indications were found of a dramatic increase in the use of imported bigeye tuna during the closure. The study concluded, however, that the 2010 closure caused buyers to give increased consideration to imports as part of their business model, and it was predicted that tuna imports could increase during any future closure. To the extent that ex-vessel prices would be reduced by this action, revenues earned by affected entities would be affected accordingly, and these impacts could occur both before and after the limit is reached, and as described above, possibly after 2020.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The potential economic effects identified above would vary among individual business entities, but it is not <?page num="21756"?>possible to predict the range of variation. Furthermore, the impacts on a particular entity would depend on both that entity's response to the proposed rule and the behavior of other vessels in the fleet, both before and after the catch limit is reached. For example, the greater the number of vessels that take advantage—before the limit is reached—of the first alternative opportunity (1), fishing as part of one of the Participating Territory's fisheries, the lower the likelihood that the limit would be reached.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The fleet's behavior in 2011 and 2012 is illustrative. In both those years, most vessels in the Hawaii fleet were included in a section 113(a) arrangement with the government of American Samoa, and as a consequence, the U.S. longline catch limit was not reached in either year. Thus, none of the vessels in the fleet, including those not included in the section 113(a) arrangements, were prohibited from fishing for bigeye tuna in the Convention Area at any time during those two years. The fleet's experience in 2010 (before opportunities under section 113(a) or Amendment 7 to the Pelagics FEP were available) provides another example of how economic impacts could be distributed among different entities. In 2010 the limit was reached and the WCPO bigeye tuna fishery was closed on November 22. As described above, dual permit vessels were able to continue fishing outside the U.S. EEZ around the Hawaiian Archipelago and benefit from the relatively high ex-vessel prices that bigeye tuna fetched during the closure.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In summary, based on potential reductions in ex-vessel revenues, NMFS has estimated that the upper bound of potential economic impacts of the proposed rule on affected longline fishing entities could be roughly $160,000 per vessel per year, on average. The actual impacts to most entities are likely to be substantially less than those upper bounds, and for some entities the impacts could be neutral or positive (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> if one or more Amendment 7 agreements are in place in 2018–2020 and the terms of the agreements are such that the U.S. longline fleet is effectively unconstrained by the catch limits).

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This element of the proposed rule would not establish any new reporting or recordkeeping requirements. The new requirement would be for affected vessel owners and operators to comply with the FAD restrictions described earlier in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-2">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</inline> section of the preamble, including FAD prohibition periods throughout the Convention Area from July 1 through September 30 in each of the years 2018–2020 and FAD prohibition periods just on the high seas in the Convention Area from November 1 through December 31 in each of the same years. There would also be a limit of 350 active FADs that may be deployed per vessel at any given time. Anecdotal information from the U.S. purse seine fishing industry indicates that U.S. purse seine vessels have not ever deployed more than 350 active FADs at any given time, so NMFS does not expect that the limit would be constraining or otherwise affect the behavior of purse seine operations, and it is not considered further in this IRFA.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">With respect to the three-month FAD closure throughout the Convention Area: Assuming that sets would be evenly distributed through the year, the number of annual FAD sets would be expected to be about three-fourths the number that would occur without a seasonal FAD closure. For example, during 2014–2016, the proportion of all sets that were made on FADs when FAD setting was allowed was 50 percent. As an indicative example, if the fleet makes 8,000 sets in a given year (somewhat more than the 2014–2016 average of 7,420 sets per year) and 50 percent of those are FAD sets, it would make 4,000 FAD sets. If there is a three-month closure and 50 percent of the sets outside the closure are FAD sets, and sets are evenly distributed throughout each year, the annual number of FAD sets would be 3,000. This can be compared to the estimated 2,494 annual FAD sets that were made in 2014–2016, on average, when there were three-month FAD closures.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">With respect to the two-month high seas FAD closure: The effects of this element are difficult to predict. If the high seas are closed to all purse seine fishing during November–December as a result of the fishing effort limit being reached, the high seas FAD closure during those two months would have no additional effect whatsoever. If the high seas are not closed to fishing, the prohibition on FAD setting would make the high seas less favorable for fishing than they otherwise would be, because only unassociated sets would be allowed there. It is not possible to characterize how influential that factor would be, however. Thus, it is not possible to predict the effects in terms of the spatial distribution of fishing effort or the proportion of fishing effort that is made on FADs.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">With respect to both the three-month FAD closure and two-month high seas FAD closure: As for the limits on fishing effort, vessel operators might choose to schedule their routine maintenance periods so as to take best advantage of the available opportunities for making FAD sets, such as during the FAD closures. However, the limited number of vessel maintenance facilities in the region might constrain vessel operators' ability to do this.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">It is emphasized that the indicative example given above is based on the assumption that the FAD set ratio would be 50 percent during periods when FAD sets are allowed, as well as that sets are distributed evenly throughout the year. These assumptions are weak from several perspectives, so the results should be interpreted with caution. First, as described above, FAD set ratios have varied widely from year to year, indicating that the conditions that dictate “optimal” FAD set ratios for the fleet vary widely from year to year, and cannot be predicted with any certainty. Second, the optimal FAD set ratio during open periods might depend on how long and when those periods occur. For example, FAD fishing might be particularly attractive soon after a closed period during which FADs aggregated fish but were not fished on. These factors are not explicitly accounted for in this analysis, but the 50 percent FAD ratio used in this analysis was taken from 2014–2016, when there was a three-month FAD closure, so it is probably a better indicator for the action alternatives than FAD set ratios for years prior to 2009, when no seasonal FAD closures were in place. With respect to the distribution of sets through the year, the existence of collective limits on fishing effort might create an incentive for individual vessels to fish harder earlier in the year than they otherwise would, resulting in a “race to fish.” Limitations on fishing effort throughout the Convention Area could cause vessels to fish (irrespective of set type or the timing of FAD closures) harder earlier in a given year than they would without the limits. However, any such effect is not expected to be great, because most vessels in the fleet tend to fish virtually full time, leaving little <?page num="21757"?>flexibility to increase fishing effort at any particular time of the year.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Vessels in the U.S. WCPO purse seine fleet make both unassociated sets and FAD sets when not constrained by regulation, so one type of set is not always more valuable or efficient than the other type. Which set type is optimal at any given time is a function of immediate conditions in and on the water, but probably also of such factors as fuel prices (unassociated sets involve more searching time and thus tend to bring higher fuel costs than FAD sets) and market conditions (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> FAD fishing, which tends to result in greater catches of lower-value skipjack tuna and smaller yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna than unassociated sets, might be more attractive and profitable when canneries are not rejecting small fish). Clearly, the ability to do either type of set is valuable, and constraints on the use of either type can be expected to bring adverse economic impacts to fishing operations. Thus, the greater the constraints on the ability to make FAD sets, the greater the expected economic impacts of the action. Because the factors affecting the relative value of FAD sets and unassociated sets are many, and the relationships among them are not well known, it is not possible to quantify the expected economic impacts of the FAD restrictions. However, it appears reasonable to conclude the following: First, the FAD restrictions would adversely impact producer surplus relative to the no-action alternative. The fact that the fleet has made such a substantial portion of its sets on FADs in the past indicates that prohibiting the use of FADs in the specified areas and periods could bring substantial costs and/or revenue losses. Second, vessel operators might be able to mitigate the impacts of the FAD restrictions by scheduling their routine vessel and equipment maintenance during the FAD closures, but this opportunity might be constrained by the limited vessel maintenance facilities in the region.

Closure of the fishery in either of those areas could thereby cause foregone fishing opportunities and associated economic losses if the area contains preferred fishing grounds during such a closure. Historical fishing rates in the two areas give a rough indication of the likelihood of the limits being reached.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Regarding the U.S. EEZ, from 2009 through 2017 (NMFS has only preliminary estimates for 2017), no more than 50 percent of the proposed limit of 458 fishing days was ever used (and no more than the 41 percent of the possible limit of 558 fishing days). This history suggests a relatively low likelihood of the proposed EEZ limit being reached in 2018–2020. However, the allowance for an extra 100 fishing days if the 458 fishing days are used by October 1 could provide an incentive for the fleet to use more fishing days in the EEZ than it otherwise would. Furthermore, this would be the first time that separate limits would be established for the EEZ and the high seas, so the incentives for individual vessels in the fleet would change. A minority of the fleet is authorized to fish in the U.S. EEZ (8 of the 33 vessels currently licensed under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty (SPTT) <ref id="fnd4e734" idref="fnd4e740" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref> have fishery endorsements on their U.S. Coast Guard Certificates of Documentation, which are required to fish in the U.S. EEZ, and 1 of the other 4 purse seine vessels with WCPFC Area Endorsements has a fishery endorsement), and with a separate limit for the U.S. EEZ, this minority might take more advantage of it than it has in the past.

In two years, 2015 and 2016, the ELAPS was closed for part of the year (starting June 15 in 2015, and September 2 in 2016), so more fishing effort might have occurred in those two years were there no limits. This history suggests a substantial likelihood of the proposed high seas limit being reached in any of the years 2018–2020.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Two factors could have a substantial influence on the amount of fishing effort in the U.S. EEZ and on the high seas in 2018–2020: First, the number of fishing days available in foreign waters (the fleet's main fishing grounds) pursuant to the SPTT will influence the incentive to fish outside those waters, including the U.S. EEZ and high seas. Second, El Niño—Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions will influence where the best fishing grounds are.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Regarding fishing opportunities in foreign waters, in December 2016, the United States and PIPs agreed upon a revised SPTT, and under this new agreement U.S. purse seine fishing businesses can purchase fishing days in the EEZs of the PIPs. There are limits on the number of such “upfront” fishing days that may be purchased. These limits can influence the amount of fishing in other areas, such as the U.S. EEZ and the high seas, as well as the EPO. For example, if the number of available upfront fishing days is relatively small, fishing effort in the U.S. EEZ and/or high seas might be relatively great. In fact, the number of upfront days available for the Kiribati EEZ, which has traditionally constituted important fishing grounds for the U.S. fleet, is notably small—only 300 fishing days per year. However, the new SPTT regime provides for U.S. purse seine fishing businesses to purchase “additional” fishing days through direct bilateral agreements with the PIPs. NMFS cannot project how many additional days will be purchased in any given years, so cannot gauge how the limits on upfront days might influence fishing effort in the U.S. EEZ or on the high seas. Limits on upfront days are therefore not considered here any further.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Additionally, effective <date date="2015-01-01">January 1, 2015</date>, Kiribati prohibited commercial fishing in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, which is a large portion of the Kiribati EEZ around the Phoenix Islands. These limitations in the Kiribati <?page num="21758"?>EEZ in 2015 probably made fishing in the ELAPS more attractive than it otherwise would be.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Regarding El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions, the eastern areas of the WCPO tend to be comparatively more attractive to the U.S. purse seine fleet during El Niño events, when warm surface water spreads from the western Pacific to the eastern Pacific and large, valuable yellowfin tuna become more vulnerable to purse seine fishing and trade winds lessen in intensity. Consequently, the U.S. EEZ and high seas, much of which is situated in the eastern range of the fleet's fishing grounds, is likely to be more important fishing grounds to the fleet during El Niño events (as compared to neutral or La Niña events). This is supported by there being a statistically significant correlation between annual average per-vessel fishing effort in the ELAPS and the Oceanic Niño Index, a common measure of ENSO conditions, over the life of the SPTT through 2010.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">El Niño conditions were present in 2015 and in the first half of 2016, and might have contributed to the relatively high rates of fishing in the ELAPS in those years. ENSO neutral conditions began in the latter half of 2016, and continued until the fourth quarter of 2017, when there was a shift to La Niña conditions, which persisted through early 2018 (and which is consistent with the moderate rates of fishing in the ELAPS in 2017). As of <date date="2018-02-08">February 8, 2018</date>, the National Weather Service states that a transition from La Niño to ENSO-neutral conditions is likely (∼55 percent chance) in March–May of 2018 (NWS 2018). Thus ENSO conditions might have a negative influence on fishing in the U.S. EEZ and the high seas early in 2018 and a largely neutral influence for the rest of 2018. Their influence on fishing effort in 2019 and 2020 cannot be predicted with any certainty.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Another potentially important factor is that the EEZ and high seas limits would be competitive limits, so their establishment could cause a “race to fish” in the two areas. That is, vessel operators might seek to take advantage of the limited number of fishing days available in the areas before the limits are reached, and fish harder in the ELAPS than they would if there were no limits. On the one hand, any such race-to-fish effect might be reflected in the history of fishing in the ELAPS, described above. On the other hand, anecdotal information from the fishing industry suggests that the limits might have been internally allocated by the fleet, which might have tempered any race to fish. It is not known whether the industry intends to internally allocate the proposed limits.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In summary, although difficult to predict, either the U.S. EEZ or high seas limits could be reached in any of the years 2018–2020, especially the high seas limits. If either limit is reached in a given year, the fleet would be prohibited from fishing in that area for the remainder of the calendar year.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The closure of any fishing grounds for any amount of time can be expected to bring adverse impacts to affected entities (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> because the open area might, during the closed period, be less productive than the closed area, and vessels might use more fuel and spend more time having to travel to open areas). The severity of the impacts of a closure would depend greatly on the length of the closure and where the most favored fishing grounds are during the closure. A study by NMFS (Chan, V. and D. Squires. 2016. Analyzing the economic impacts of the 2015 ELAPS closure. NMFS Internal Report) estimated that the overall losses to the combined sectors of the vessels, canneries and vessel support companies from the 2015 ELAPS closure ranged from $11 million and $110 million depending on the counterfactual period considered. These results suggest that there were impacts from the ELAPS closure on the American Samoa economy and a connection between U.S. purse seine vessels and the broader American Samoa economy.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">With respect to fishing in the EPO: The fleet has generally increased its fishing operations in the EPO since 2014, and as of 2017, there were 17 purse seine vessel in the WCPO fleet that are also listed on the IATTC Vessel Register. In order to fish in the EPO, a vessel must be on the IATTC's Regional Vessel Register and categorized as active (<ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s300.22/b">50 CFR 300.22(b)</ref>), which involves fees of about $14.95 per cubic meter of well space per year (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> a vessel with 1,200 m<sup style="-uslm-sgm:SU">3</sup> of well space would be subject to annual fees of $17,940). (As an exception to this rule, an SPTT-licensed vessel is allowed to make one fishing trip in the EPO each year without being categorized as active on the IATTC Regional Vessel Register. The trip must not exceed 90 days in length, and there is an annual limit of 32 such trips for the entire SPTT-licensed fleet (<ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s300.22/b/1">50 CFR 300.22(b)(1)</ref>).) The number of U.S. purse seine vessels in the WCPO fleet that have opted to be categorized as such has increased in the last few years from zero to 17, probably largely a result of constraints on fishing days in the WCPO and/or uncertainty in future access arrangements under the SPTT. This suggests an increasing attractiveness of fishing in the EPO, in spite of the costs associated with doing so. However, in 2018 vessels probably will not have the opportunity to fish in the EPO year-round. To implement a recent decision of the IATTC, NMFS has published a final rule that requires purse seine vessels to choose between two EPO fishing prohibition periods each year in 2018–2020: July 29–October 8 or November 9–January 19 (72 days in either case). Thus, the opportunity to fish in the EPO might be constrained, depending on when the U.S. EEZ and/or high seas in the WCPFC Area is closed, and which EPO closure period a given vessel operator chooses.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">With respect to not fishing at all during a closure of the U.S. EEZ or high seas: This would mean a loss of any revenues from fishing. However, many of the vessels' variable operating costs would be avoided in that case, and it is possible that for some vessels a portion of the time might be used for productive activities like vessel and equipment maintenance.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The opportunity costs of engaging in next-best opportunities in the event of a closure are not known, so the potential impacts cannot be quantified. However, to give an indication of the magnitude of possible economic impacts to producers in the fishery (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> an indication of the upper bound of those impacts), information on revenues per day is provided here.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The last five years for which catch estimates for the U.S. WCPO purse seine fleet are available are 2012–2016. Those estimates, adjusted to an indicative fleet size of 35 vessels, equate to annual average catches of skipjack tuna, yellowfin tuna, and bigeye tuna of 236,077 mt, 24,802 mt, and 4,213 mt, respectively, or 265,091 mt in total. Applying an indicative current Bangkok cannery price for skipjack tuna of $1,500 per mt to all three species, the value of annual fleet-wide catches at 2012–2016 average levels would be about $398 million, equivalent to a little more than $1 million per calendar day, on average. It should be noted that cannery prices are fairly volatile; for example, cannery prices are much lower now than prices during most of 2017.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition to the effects described above, the proposed limits could affect the temporal distribution of fishing effort in the U.S. purse seine fishery. Since the limits would apply fleet-wide—that is, they would not be allocated to individual vessels—vessel operators might have an incentive to fish harder in the affected areas earlier in each calendar year than they otherwise would. Such a race-to-fish effect might also be expected in the time period between when a closure of the fishery is announced and when it is actually closed, which would be at least seven calendar days. To the extent such temporal shifts occur, they could affect the seasonal timing of fish catches and deliveries to canneries. The timing of cannery deliveries by the U.S. fleet alone (as it might be affected by a race to fish in the EEZ or high seas) is unlikely to have an appreciable impact on prices, because many canneries in the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere buy from the fleets of multiple nations. A race to fish could bring costs to affected entities if it causes vessel operators to forego vessel maintenance in favor of fishing or to fish in weather or ocean conditions that they otherwise would not. This could bring costs in terms of the health and safety of the crew as well as the economic performance of the vessel.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This element of the proposed rule would remove a reporting/recordkeeping requirement, the requirement to notify NMFS when entering and exiting the EHSSMA. It would also establish a prohibition on transshipment in the EHSSMA.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Fulfillment of this element's requirements is not expected to require any professional skills that the vessel owners and operators do not already possess.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Regarding the entry/exit notices, when NMFS established the requirement in 2012 (final rule published <date date="2012-12-03">December 3, 2012</date>; <ref href="/us/fr/77/71501">77 FR 71501</ref>), it estimated that each report would require about 15 minutes of labor (at a labor cost of about $60 per hour) and no more than $1 in communication costs, for an estimated total cost of compliance of about $16 per notice. At that time, NMFS estimated that each longline vessel would enter and exit the EHSSMA between zero and approximately four times per year (requiring 0–8 notices per year at an annual cost of $0–128), each purse seine vessel would do so between zero and approximately two times per year (requiring 0–4 notices per year at an annual cost of $0–64), and each albacore troll vessel would do so between zero and two times per year (requiring 0–4 notices per year at an annual cost of $0–64). According to the notices received by NMFS, zero longline vessels and zero albacore troll vessels have entered the EHSSMA from 2013 through 2017, and there have been nine entries/exits by purse seine fishing vessels. In any case, under the proposed rule, commercial fishing vessels would be relieved of about $16 in compliance costs each time they enter or exit the EHSSMA.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As described above, the type of the impacts would vary greatly among fishing gear types (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> longline versus albacore troll versus purse seine), and the magnitude of the impacts also could vary greatly by fishing gear type (but they are difficult to quantify and compare). Nevertheless, all the affected entities in the longline and albacore troll fishing sectors are small entities, so there would be no disproportionate impacts between small and large entities within those sectors. In the purse seine fishing sector, slightly more than half the affected entities are small entities. The direct effect of the proposed rule would be to constrain fishing effort by purse seine fishing vessels, with consequent constraining effects on both revenues (because catches would be less) and operating costs (because less fishing would be undertaken). Although some purse seine fishing entities are larger than others, NMFS is not aware of any differences between the small entities and the large entities (as defined by the RFA) in terms of their capital costs, operating costs, or other aspects of their businesses. Accordingly, there is no information to suggest that the direct adverse economic impacts on small purse seine entities would be disproportionately greater than those on large purse seine entities.

Taking no action could result in lesser adverse economic impacts than the proposed action for affected entities (but as described below, for some affected longline entities, the proposed rule could be more economically beneficial than no-action), but NMFS does not prefer the no-action alternative, because it would be inconsistent with the United States' obligations under the Convention. Alternatives identified for each of the four elements of the proposed rule are discussed below.

CMM 2017–01 allows members to choose either November–December, as in this proposed rule, or April–May. NMFS has compared the expected direct economic impacts of the two alternatives on purse seine fishing businesses in the regulatory impact review for the proposed rule. The analysis finds that a November–December closure is more likely to have a lesser direct economic impact on those businesses than an April–May closure, primarily because the later closure period is more likely to run concurrently with a closure of the high seas in the Convention Area to purse seine fishing (if the fishing effort limit in this proposed rule is reached), in which case the FAD closure would bring no additional economic impacts.

For this <?page num="21760"?>proposed rule, in light of CMM 2017–01's provision allowing the United States to transfer some of its EEZ fishing days to the high seas, there is a need to separately account for the U.S. high seas limit and the U.S. EEZ limit. Thus, combining the two limits into a single limit for the ELAPS is not a practical alternative, and NMFS has not considered it in detail.

The Agency has the authority to reserve funds for those programs (referred to as the “underlying programs”) included in Strategic Economic and Community Development (SECD), for projects that support multijurisdictional strategic economic and community development plans. This Notice supersedes the SECD fiscal year 2016 (FY) notice that published on <date date="2016-03-17">March 17, 2016</date> and identifies that for FY 2018 the Agency will utilize priority points under the SECD provisions, as opposed to set-aside funding.

It also helps the public understand the Department's information collection requirements and provide the requested data in the desired format. ED is soliciting comments on the proposed information collection request (ICR) that is described below. The Department of Education is especially interested in public comment addressing the following issues: (1) Is this collection necessary to the proper functions of the Department; (2) will this information be processed and used in a timely manner; (3) is the estimate of burden accurate; (4) how might the Department enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (5) how might the Department minimize the burden of this collection on the respondents, including through the use of information technology. Please note that written comments received in response to this notice will be considered public records.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under each CSAPR trading program where EPA is responsible for determining emission allowance allocations, a portion of each state's emissions budget for the program for each control period is reserved in a NUSA (and in an additional Indian country NUSA in the case of states with Indian country within their borders) for allocation to certain units that would not otherwise receive allowance allocations. The procedures for identifying the eligible units for each control period and for allocating allowances from the NUSAs and Indian country NUSAs to these units are set forth in the CSAPR trading program regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s97.411/b">40 CFR 97.411(b)</ref> and 97.412 (NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline> Annual), 97.511(b) and 97.512 (NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline> Ozone Season Group 1), 97.611(b) and 97.612 (SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> Group 1), 97.711(b) and 97.712 (SO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">2</inline> Group 2), and 97.811(b) and 97.812 (NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline> Ozone Season Group 2). Each NUSA allowance allocation process involves up to two rounds of allocations to eligible units, termed “new” units, followed by the allocation to “existing” units of any allowances not allocated to new units.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This notice concerns preliminary calculations for the first round of NUSA allowance allocations for the 2018 control periods. Generally, the allocation procedures call for each eligible unit to receive a first-round 2018 NUSA allocation equal to its 2017 emissions as reported under <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/p75">40 CFR part 75</ref> unless the total of such allocations to all eligible units would exceed the amount of allowances in the NUSA, in which case the allocations are reduced on a pro-rata basis.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The detailed unit-by-unit data and preliminary allowance allocation calculations are set forth in Excel spreadsheets titled “CSAPR_NUSA_2018_NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline>_Annual_1st_Round_Prelim_Data”, “CSAPR_NUSA_2018_NO<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-5-2">X</inline>_OS_1st_Round_Prelim_Data”, and “CSAPR_NUSA_2018_SO2_1st_Round_Prelim_Data,” available on EPA's website at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.epa.gov/csapr/new-unit-set-aside-notices-data-availability-nusa-noda-cross-state-air-pollution-rule.</inline> Each of the spreadsheets contains a separate worksheet for each state covered by that program showing, for each unit identified as eligible for a first-round NUSA allocation, (1) the unit's emissions in the 2017 control period (annual or ozone season as applicable), (2) the maximum first-round 2018 NUSA allowance allocation for which the unit is eligible (typically the unit's emissions in the 2017 control period), (3) various adjustments to the unit's maximum allocation, many of which are necessary only if the NUSA pool is oversubscribed, and (4) the preliminary calculation of the unit's first-round 2018 NUSA allowance allocation.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Each state worksheet also contains a summary showing (1) the quantity of allowances initially available in that state's 2018 NUSA, (2) the sum of the first-round 2018 NUSA allowance allocations that will be made to new units in that state, assuming there are no corrections to the data, and (3) the quantity of allowances that would remain in the 2018 NUSA for use in second-round allocations to new units (or ultimately for allocation to existing units), again assuming there are no corrections to the data.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Objections should be strictly limited to the data and calculations upon which the NUSA allowance allocations are based and should be emailed to the address identified in <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-2">ADDRESSES</inline>. Objections must include: (1) Precise identification of the specific data and/or calculations the commenter believes are inaccurate, (2) new proposed data and/or calculations upon which the commenter believes EPA should rely instead to determine allowance allocations, and (3) the reasons why EPA should rely on the commenter's <?page num="21773"?>proposed data and/or calculations and not the data referenced in this notice.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">EPA notes that an allocation or lack of allocation of allowances to a given unit does not constitute a determination that CSAPR does or does not apply to the unit. EPA also notes that under <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s97.411/c">40 CFR 97.411(c)</ref>, 97.511(c), 97.611(c), 97.711(c), and 97.811(c), allocations are subject to potential correction if a unit to which allowances have been allocated for a given control period is not actually an affected unit as of the start of that control period.</p>

Comments are requested concerning: whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Commission, including whether the information shall have practical utility; the accuracy of the Commission's burden estimate; ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on the respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology; and ways to further reduce the information collection burden on small business concerns with fewer than 25 employees.

No person shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information subject to the PRA that does not display a valid OMB control number.

FCC Form 601 is composed of a main form that contains administrative information and a series of schedules used for filing technical and other information. This form is used to apply for a new license, to amend or withdraw a pending application, to modify or renew an existing license, cancel a license, request a duplicate license, submit required notifications, request an extension of time to satisfy construction requirements, or request an administrative update to an existing license (such as mailing address change), request a Special Temporary Authority or Developmental License. Respondents are encouraged to submit FCC Form 601 electronically and are required to do so when submitting FCC Form 601 to apply for an authorization for which the applicant was the winning bidder in a spectrum auction.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The data collected on FCC Form 601 includes the FCC Registration Number (FRN), which serves as a “common link” for all filings an entity has with the FCC. The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 requires entities filing with the Commission to use an FRN.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FCC Form 601 is being revised by Sections 90.35, 90.20 and 90.175 to require third party disclosures by wireless license applicants proposing to operate a vehicular repeater units on designated frequencies. They are required to obtain written concurrence of a frequency coordinator. This information submitted as an attachment to FCC form 601 will be used by Commission personnel in evaluating the applicant's need for such frequencies and to minimize the interference potential to other stations operating on the proposed frequencies.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, <ref href="/us/usc/t44/s3501–3521">44 U.S.C. 3501–3521</ref>, AHRQ invites the public to comment on this proposed information collection. In 1999, the Institute of Medicine called for health care organizations to develop a “culture of safety” such that their workforce and processes focus on improving the reliability and safety of care for patients (IOM, 1999; <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System</inline>). To respond to the need for tools to assess patient safety culture in health care, AHRQ developed and pilot tested the Medical Office Survey on Patient Safety Culture with OMB approval (OMB NO.0935–0131; Approved <date date="2007-07-05">July 5, 2007</date>).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The survey is designed to enable medical offices to assess provider and staff perspectives about patient safety issues, medical error, and error reporting. The survey includes 38 items that measure 10 composites of patient safety culture. In addition to the composite items, 14 items measure staff perceptions of how often medical offices have problems exchanging information with other settings as well as other patient safety and quality issues. AHRQ made the survey publicly available along with a Survey User's Guide and other toolkit materials in December, 2008 on the AHRQ website (located at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.ahrq.gov/sops/quality-patient-safety/patientsafetyculture/medical-office/index.html</inline>).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The AHRQ Medical Office SOPS Database consists of data from the AHRQ Medical Office Survey on Patient Safety Culture and may include reportable, non-required supplemental items. Medical offices in the U.S. can voluntarily submit data from the survey to AHRQ, through its contractor, Westat. The Medical Office SOPS Database (OMB NO. 0935–0196, last approved on <date date="2015-08-25">August 25, 2015</date>) was developed by AHRQ in 2011 in response to requests from medical offices interested in tracking their own survey results. Those organizations submitting data receive a feedback report, as well as a report of the aggregated, de-identified findings of the other medical offices submitting data. These reports are used to assist medical office staff in their efforts to improve patient safety culture in their organizations.

The survey, toolkit materials, and database results are all made publicly available on AHRQ's website. Technical assistance is provided by AHRQ through its contractor at no charge to medical offices, to facilitate the use of these materials for medical office patient safety and quality improvement.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">To achieve the goal of this project the following activities and data collections will be implemented:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(1) <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Eligibility and Registration Form—</inline>The medical office point-of-contact (POC) completes a number of data submission steps and forms, beginning with the completion of an online Eligibility and Registration Form. The purpose of this form is to collect basic demographic information about the medical office and initiate the registration process.

This information will be used to analyze data collected with the Medical Office SOPS survey.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(4) <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Data Files Submission—</inline>POCs upload their data file(s), using the medical office data file specifications, to ensure that users submit standardized and consistent data in the way variables are named, coded, and formatted. The number of submissions to the database is likely to vary each year because medical offices do not administer the survey and submit data every year. Data submission is typically handled by one POC who is either an office manager or a survey vendor who contracts with a medical office to collect their data. POCs submit data on behalf of 35 medical offices, on average, because many medical offices are part of a health system that includes many medical office sites, or the POC is a vendor that is submitting data for multiple medical offices.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Survey data from the AHRQ Medical Office Survey on Patient Safety Culture are used to produce three types of products:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(1) A Medical Office SOPS Database Report that is made publicly available on the AHRQ website (see Medical Office User Database Report);
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(2) Individual Medical Office Survey Feedback Reports that are customized for each medical office that submits data to the database; and
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(3) Research data sets of individual-level and medical office-level de-identified data to enable researchers to conduct analyses. All data released in a data set are de-identified at the individual-level and the medical office-level.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Medical offices will be invited to voluntarily submit their Medical Office SOPS survey data to the database. AHRQ's contractor, Westat, then cleans and aggregates the data to produce a PDF-formatted Database Report displaying averages, standard deviations, and percentile scores on the survey's 38 items and 10 patient safety culture composites of patient safety culture, and 14 items measuring how often medical offices have problems exchanging information with other settings and other patient safety and quality issues. The report also displays these results by medical office characteristics (size of office, specialty, geographic region, etc.) and respondent characteristics (staff position).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Database Report includes a section on data limitations, emphasizing that the report does not reflect a representative sampling of the U.S. medical office population. Because participating medical offices will choose to voluntarily submit their data into the database and therefore are not a random or national sample of medical offices, estimates based on this self-selected group might be biased estimates. We recommend that users review the database results with these caveats in mind.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Each medical office that submits its data receives a customized survey feedback report that presents their results alongside the aggregated results from other participating medical offices.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Background and Brief Description
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Before CDC disseminates a health message to the public, the message always undergoes scientific review. Even though the message is based on sound scientific content, there is no guarantee that the public will understand a health message or that the message will move people to take a recommended action. Communication theorists and researchers agree that for health messages to be as clear and influential as possible, target audience members or representatives must be involved in developing the messages, and provisional versions of the messages must be tested with members of the target audience.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Increasingly, there are circumstances when CDC must move swiftly to protect life, prevent disease, or calm public anxiety. Health message testing is even more important in these instances, because of the critical nature of the information need.








 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the interest of timely health message dissemination, many programs forgo the important step of testing messages on dimensions such as clarity, salience, appeal, and persuasiveness (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> the ability to influence behavioral intention). Skipping this step avoids the delay involved in the standard OMB review process, but at a high potential cost. Untested messages can waste communication resources and opportunities because the messages can be perceived as unclear or irrelevant. Untested messages can also have unintended consequences, such as jeopardizing the credibility of Federal health officials.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Health Message Testing System (HMTS), a generic information collection, enables programs across CDC to collect the information they require in a timely manner to:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Ensure quality and prevent waste in the dissemination of health information by CDC to the public.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Refine message concepts and to test draft materials for clarity, salience, appeal, and persuasiveness to target audiences.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Guide the action of health communication officials who are responding to health emergencies, Congressionally-mandated campaigns with short timeframes, media-generated public concern, time-limited communication opportunities, trends, and the need to refresh materials or dissemination strategies in an ongoing campaign.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Ensure each testing instrument will be based on specific health issues or topics.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Although it is not possible to develop one instrument for use in all instances, the same kinds of questions are asked in most message testing. This package includes generic questions and formats that can used to develop health message testing data collection instruments. These include a list of screening questions, comprised of demographic and introductory questions, along with other questions that can be used to create a mix of relevant questions for each proposed message testing data collection method. However, programs may request to use additional questions if needed.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Message testing questions will focus on issues such as comprehension, impressions, personal relevance, content and wording, efficacy of response, channels, and spokesperson/sponsor. Such information will enable message developers to enhance the effectiveness of messages for intended audiences.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Data collection methods proposed for HMTS includes intercept interviews, telephone interviews, focus groups, online surveys, and cognitive interviews. In almost all instances, data will be collected by outside organizations under contract with CDC.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For many years CDC programs have used HMTS to test and refine message concepts and test draft materials for clarity, salience, appeal, and persuasiveness to target audiences. Having this generic clearance available has enabled them to test their information and get critical health information out to the public quickly. Over the last three years, more than 30 messages have been tested using this clearance. Examples of use of the HMTS mechanism include:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(1) Domestic Readiness Initiative on Zika Virus Disease-Year 2 Core Campaign Materials. As part of the mission of CDC's Domestic Readiness Initiative on the Zika Virus Disease, CDC collected information to inform an outcome evaluation to determine the extent to which the campaign affected awareness, attitudes, and intention to follow recommended behaviors at different points during the campaign. The goal of the evaluation was to better understand awareness of campaign activities, how people perceive Zika as a health risk, and assess their uptake of recommended health behaviors, such as applying insect repellent, using condoms, and wearing long-sleeved clothing.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(2) Assessing Perception and Use of CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The purpose of this collection is to assess primary care physician's perceptions and use of communication materials and products associated with the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. Information collected can assist in the most effective use of CDC communication resources and opportunities by assessing clarity, salience, appeal, persuasiveness and effectiveness of materials promoting the dissemination and implementation of the Guideline. Specifically, CDC seeks to understand how primary care physicians perceive, need, and implement the Guideline to make prescribing decisions; how they need, obtain, and use supplementary and promotional Guideline materials developed by CDC for professional development or patient education; and what attitudinal and structural barriers may inhibit primary care provider adoption of the recommendations in the Guideline.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Over 10,000 respondents were queried and over 4,500 burden hours used during the most recent approval period. Because the availability of this ICR has been so critical to programs in disseminating their materials and <?page num="21778"?>information to the public in a timely manner, OADC is requesting a three year extension of this information collection. The estimated annualized Burden Hours are 2,470. There is no cost to the respondents other than their time.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has submitted the information collection request titled Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. CDC previously published a “Proposed Data Collection Submitted for Public Comment and Recommendations” notice on [insert <date date="2017-08-22">August 22, 2017</date>] to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies. CDC received 1 comment related to the previous notice. This notice serves to allow an additional 30 days for public and affected agency comments.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">CDC will accept all comments for this proposed information collection project. The Office of Management and Budget is particularly interested in comments that:

</p>
                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Background and Brief Description
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) requests a revision of the currently approved Information Collection Request: “Medical Monitoring Project” expiring <date date="2018-06-30">June 30, 2018</date>. This data collection addresses the need for national estimates of access to and utilization of HIV-related medical care and services, the quality of HIV-related ambulatory care, and HIV-related behaviors and clinical outcomes.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For the proposed project, the same data collection methods will be used as for the currently approved project. Data would be collected from a probability sample of HIV-diagnosed adults in the U.S. who consent to an interview and abstraction of their medical records. As for the currently approved project, de-identified information would also be extracted from HIV case surveillance records for a dataset, referred to as the minimum dataset, which is used to assess non-response bias, for quality control, to improve the ability of MMP to monitor ongoing care and treatment of HIV-infected persons, and to make inferences from the MMP sample to HIV-diagnosed persons nationally. No other Federal agency collects such nationally representative population-based information from HIV-diagnosed adults. The data are expected to have significant implications for policy, program development, and resource allocation at the state/local and national levels.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The changes proposed in this request update the data collection system to meet prevailing information needs and enhance the value of MMP data, while remaining within the scope of the currently approved project purpose. The result is a 11% reduction in burden, or a reduction of 786 total burden hours annually. Specifically, the removal of three unfunded project areas reduces the number of interviews conducted and the number of persons for whom healthcare facility staff will be asked for contact information, assistance with approaching for participation, and pulling medical records.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Changes were made that did not affect the burden, listed below:
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Sampled persons found to have resided in a non-funded project area on the date of sampling will be considered ineligible for the project, because non-funded project areas were deemed ineligible in the first stage of sampling.








 
<?page num="21779"?></p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Tracking data reports will no longer be sent to CDC, as this information is no longer needed.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• The average token of appreciation for participants has been increased from $25 to $50.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Non-substantive changes have been made to recruitment materials to decrease the reading comprehension level, simplify and standardize procedures, and incorporate a user-friendly eligibility checklist.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Changes have been made to the respondent consent form to decrease the reading comprehension level and clarify whom participants should contact for different concerns.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Forty-three data elements were removed from the minimum data set and thirty-seven data elements were added. Because these data elements are extracted from the HIV surveillance system from which they are sampled, these changes do not affect the burden of the project.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Revisions to the interview questionnaire were made to improve coherence, boost the efficiency of the data collection, and increase the relevance and value of the information. Based on an evaluation of the currently approved MMP interview instrument 118 questions were added to the interview form and 221 questions were removed. However, the average amount of time to complete the interview did not change.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Thirty-nine data elements were removed from the MRA data structure because they were not found to be useful. No new elements were added. Because the medical records are abstracted by MMP staff, these changes do not affect the burden of the project.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This proposed data collection would supplement the National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS, OMB Control No. 0920–0573, Exp. 6/30/2019) in 23 selected state and local health departments, which collect information on persons diagnosed with, living with, and dying from HIV infection and AIDS.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Through their participation, respondents will help to improve programs to prevent HIV infection as well as services for those who already have HIV. The total burden hours are 6,354 hours. The participation of respondents is voluntary. There is no cost to the respondents other than their time.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P"><ref href="/us/pl/102/493/s2/a">Section 2(a) of Public Law 102–493</ref> (known as the Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act of 1992 (FCSRCA), <ref href="/us/usc/t42/s263a–1/a">42 U.S.C. 263a–1(a)</ref>) requires that each assisted reproductive technology (ART) program shall annually report to the Secretary through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: (1) Pregnancy success rates achieved by such ART program, and (2) the identity of each embryo laboratory used by such ART program and whether the laboratory is certified or has applied for such certification under the Act. The required information is currently reported by ART programs to CDC as specified in the Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Program Reporting System (OMB no. 0920–0556, exp. 7/31/2018). CDC seeks to extend OMB approval for a period of three years. The revised total burden estimate is lower than under the previous approval, due to removal of the burden associated with a one-time system upgrade that was completed under the prior approval. However, some of this burden reduction will be offset by an increase in the number of ART clinics and cycles reported, due to an increase in the utilization of ART in the United States.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The currently approved program reporting system, also known as the National ART Surveillance System (NASS), includes information about all ART cycles initiated by any of the ART programs in the United States. An ART cycle is considered to begin when a woman begins taking ovarian stimulatory drugs or starts ovarian monitoring with the intent of having embryos transferred; for each cycle. CDC collects information about the pregnancy outcome, as well as a number of data items deemed by experts in the field to be important to explain variability in success rates across ART programs and individuals.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Each ART program reports its annual ART cycle data to CDC in mid-December. The annual data reporting consists of information about all ART cycles that were initiated in the previous calendar year. For example, the December 2017 reports described ART cycles that were initiated between <date date="2016-01-01">January 1, 2016</date>, and <date date="2016-12-31">December 31, 2016</date>. Data elements and definitions currently in use reflect CDC's prior consultations with representatives of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART), the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, and RESOLVE: the National Infertility Association (a national, nonprofit consumer organization), as well as a variety of individuals with expertise and interest in this field.








 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The estimated number of respondents (ART programs or clinics) is 464, based on the number of clinics that provided information in 2015; the estimated average number of responses (ART cycles) per respondent is 350. Additionally, approximately 5–10% of responding clinics will be randomly selected each year to participate in data validation and quality control activities; an estimated 35 clinics will be selected to report validation data on 70 cycles each on average. Finally, respondents may provide feedback to CDC about the usability and utility of the reporting system. The option to participate in the feedback survey is presented to respondents when they complete their required data submission. Participation in the feedback survey is voluntary and is not required by the FCSRCA. CDC estimates that 75% of ART programs will participate in the feedback survey.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The collection of ART cycle information allows CDC to publish an annual report to Congress as specified by the FCSRCA and to provide information needed by consumers. OMB approval is requested for three years and there are no costs to respondents other than their time.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is establishing a public docket to assist with its development of a policy/guidance document on the assessment of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) for therapeutic proteins (TPs). The Agency split the 2012 DDI draft guidance into two draft guidance documents published in October 2017: “In Vitro Metabolism- and Transporter-Mediated Drug-Drug Interaction Studies” and “Clinical Drug Interaction Studies—Study Design, Data Analysis, and Clinical Implications.” The two guidance documents focus on enzyme- and transporter-based DDIs and do not include a discussion on TPs, which was originally included in the 2012 guidance. The Agency is currently revisiting the framework for assessment of DDIs for TPs outlined in the draft 2012 DDI guidance to offer timely and actionable information pertaining to DDIs for TPs and is seeking public input to assist in updating or creating a new framework.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Concurrent use of more than one prescription drug is common. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey reports that about 20 percent of U.S. adults take three or more prescription drugs; and among adults age 65 and older, 40 percent take five or more medications.<ref id="fnd2e3171" idref="fnd2e3179" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref> Taking more than one drug at a time can result in DDIs which can result in toxicities or loss of efficacy. It is impractical to evaluate the impact of every possible drug combination. Therefore, the FDA <?page num="21782"?>follows a systematic risk-based approach for DDI assessment.

The Agency now plans to revisit the previous framework for the assessment of DDIs for TPs that was included in the 2012 draft guidance. We are seeking public input on the revision and development of a framework to address DDIs for TPs with the goal of publishing this framework in a short policy/guidance document.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a guidance entitled “S3A Guidance: Note for Guidance on Toxicokinetics: The Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies: Focus on Microsampling—Questions and Answers.” The guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation. This question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) guidance provides additional information to facilitate interpretation of the guideline for industry “S3A Toxicokinetics: The Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies” (S3A guidance), especially to address the benefit and use of microsampling techniques in main study animals. The Q&amp;A guidance is intended to provide points to consider before incorporating the microsampling method in toxicokinetic studies and acknowledges the benefits (and some limitations) of the use of microsampling.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In recent years, regulatory authorities and industry associations from around the world have participated in many important initiatives to promote international harmonization of regulatory requirements under the ICH. FDA has participated in several ICH meetings designed to enhance harmonization, and FDA is committed to seeking scientifically based harmonized technical procedures for pharmaceutical development. One of the goals of harmonization is to identify and reduce differences in technical requirements for drug development among regulatory agencies.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">ICH was established to provide an opportunity for harmonization initiatives to be developed with input from both regulatory and industry representatives. FDA also seeks input from consumer representatives and others. ICH is concerned with harmonization of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products for human use among regulators around the world. The six founding members of the ICH are the European Commission; the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations; FDA; the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare; the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association; and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. The Standing Members of the ICH Association include Health Canada and Swissmedic. Any party eligible as a member in accordance with the ICH Articles of Association can apply for membership in writing to the ICH Secretariat. The ICH Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation of documentation, operates as an international nonprofit organization and is funded by the Members of the ICH Association.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The ICH Assembly is the overarching body of the Association and includes representatives from each of the ICH members and observers. The Assembly is responsible for the endorsement of draft guidelines and adoption of final guidelines. FDA publishes ICH guidelines as FDA guidance.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> of <date date="2016-09-08">September 8, 2016</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/81/62141">81 FR 62141</ref>), FDA published a notice announcing the availability of a draft guidance entitled “ICH S3A Guidance: Note for Guidance on Toxicokinetics: The Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies—Questions and Answers.” The notice gave interested persons an opportunity to submit comments by <date date="2016-12-07">December 7, 2016</date>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">After consideration of the comments received and revisions to the guideline, a final draft of the guideline was submitted to the ICH Assembly and endorsed by the regulatory agencies in November 2017.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Q&amp;A guidance provides additional information to facilitate interpretation of the S3A guidance. The S3A guidance has been successfully implemented since 1994, and in recent years, analytical method sensitivity has improved, allowing microsampling techniques to be used in toxicokinetic assessment. This Q&amp;A guidance focuses on points to consider before incorporating the microsampling method in toxicokinetic studies, acknowledges the benefits (and some limitations) of the use of microsampling for assessing toxicokinetics in main study animals, and acknowledges the overall important contribution of microsampling to the 3Rs benefits (replacement, reduction, and refinement), by reducing or eliminating the need for toxicokinetic satellite animals.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Q&amp;A guidance is intended to apply to the majority of pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals; however, for all types of molecules, consideration should be given on a case-by-case basis as to whether the sensitivity of the measurement method is appropriate for the small sample volumes available. The guidance on microsampling provided in the Q&amp;A can be used in any type of toxicology study, as well as in rodents and nonrodents.

The guidance represents the current thinking of FDA on “S3A Guidance: Note for Guidance on Toxicokinetics: The Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies: Focus on Microsampling—Questions and Answers.” It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FDA is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled “Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections: Developing Drugs for <?page num="21785"?>Treatment.” The purpose of this draft guidance is to assist sponsors in the development of new drugs for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This draft guidance defines enrollment criteria for uncomplicated urinary tract infection trials and provides options for clinical trials designed to demonstrate efficacy. An appendix to this draft guidance describes the justification for the noninferiority margin to be used for the option of active-controlled trials designed to demonstrate noninferiority. In addition, this draft guidance reflects recent developments in scientific information that pertain to drugs being developed for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Issuance of this draft guidance fulfills a portion of the requirements of Title VIII, section 804, of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (<ref href="/us/pl/112/144">Pub. L. 112–144</ref>), which requires FDA to review and, as appropriate, revise not fewer than three guidance documents per year for the conduct of clinical trials with respect to antibacterial and antifungal drugs. In 1998, FDA published a draft guidance entitled “Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections—Developing Antimicrobial Drugs for Treatment” (the 1998 draft guidance). In a <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> notice dated <date date="2013-08-07">August 7, 2013</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/78/48175">78 FR 48175</ref>), FDA announced an initiative in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research involving the review of draft guidance documents issued before 2010 to determine their status and to decide whether those guidances should be withdrawn, revised, or finalized with only minor changes. In the same <date date="2013-08-07">August 7, 2013</date>, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> notice, FDA announced that the 1998 draft guidance, as well as other draft guidances, was being withdrawn (<ref href="/us/fr/78/48175">78 FR 48175</ref>). FDA is now issuing a new draft guidance that revises the recommendations in the 1998 draft guidance.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This draft guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good guidance practices regulation (<ref href="/us/cfr/t21/s10.115">21 CFR 10.115</ref>). The draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of FDA on developing drugs for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. This guidance is not subject to <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>.

The ICR documentation will be available at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">http://www.reginfo.gov</inline> upon its submission to OMB. Therefore, in preparation for OMB review and approval of the following information collection, TSA is soliciting comments to—

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">OMB Control Number 1652–0039; TSA Claims Application, previously named the TSA Claims Management Branch Program, allows the agency to collect information from claimants in order to thoroughly examine and resolve tort claims against the agency. TSA is revising the collection by changing the name from “TSA Claims Management Branch Program” to “TSA Claims Application.” TSA receives approximately 850 tort claims per month arising from airport screening activities and other circumstances, including motor vehicle accidents and employee loss. The Federal Tort Claims Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t28/s1346/b">28 U.S.C. 1346(b)</ref>, 1402(b), 2401(b), 2671–2680) is the authority under which the TSA Claims, Outreach and Debt Branch adjudicates tort claims.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The data is collected whenever an individual believes s/he has experienced property loss or damage, a personal injury, or other damages due to the negligence or wrongful act or omission of a TSA employee, and decides to file a Federal tort claim against TSA. Submission of a claim is entirely voluntary and initiated by individuals. The claimants (or respondents) to this collection are typically the traveling public. Currently, claimants file a claim by submitting to TSA a Standard Form 95 (SF–95), which has been approved under OMB control number 1105–0008. Because TSA requires further clarifying information, claimants are asked to complete a Supplemental Information page added to the SF–95. If TSA determines payment is warranted, TSA will send the claimant a form requesting banking information (routing and accounting numbers) in order to direct payment to the claimant. This form has been approved under OMB control number 1652–0039.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Claim instructions and forms are available through the TSA website at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">http://www.tsa.gov.</inline> Claimants must download these forms and mail or fax them to TSA. On the Supplemental Information page, claimants are asked to provide additional claim information including: (1) Email address, (2) airport, (3) location of incident within the airport, (4) complete travel itinerary, (5) whether baggage was delayed by the airline, (6) why they believe TSA was negligent, (7) whether they used a third-party baggage service, (8) whether they were traveling under military orders, and (9) whether they submitted claims with the airline or insurance companies.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">If TSA determines payment is warranted, TSA sends the claimant a form requesting: (1) Claimant signature, (2) banking information, and (3) Social Security number (required by the U.S. Treasury for all Government payments to the public pursuant to <ref href="/us/usc/t31/s3325">31 U.S.C. 3325</ref>).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under the current system of claims submitted by mail or fax, TSA estimates there will be approximately 10,200 respondents on an annual basis, for a total annual hour burden of 5,300 hours.

Because this lease sale is proposed to occur in 2019, and given the long lead time needed to prepare for a proposed sale, the planning process must begin now or the option of a lease sale in 2019 would be precluded. However, the Call is not a decision to lease and is not a prejudgment by the Secretary concerning any area that may be made available for leasing under the 2019–2024 National OCS Program. Please refer to the original <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> notice for additional information related to the Call for Information and Nominations.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">BOEM will protect privileged or proprietary information that industry submits in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and OCSLA requirements. To avoid inadvertent release of such information, all documents and every page containing such information should be marked with the statement, “Confidential—Contains Proprietary Information.” To the extent a document contains a mix of proprietary and nonproprietary information, the document should be clearly marked to indicate which portion of the document is proprietary and which is not. Exemption 4 of FOIA applies to trade secrets and commercial or financial information that you submit that is privileged or confidential. The OCSLA states that the “Secretary shall maintain the confidentiality of all privileged or proprietary data or information for such period of time as is provided for in this subchapter, established by regulation, or agreed to by the parties” (<ref href="/us/usc/t43/s1344/g">43 U.S.C. 1344(g)</ref>). BOEM considers nominations of specific blocks to be proprietary, and therefore BOEM will not release information that identifies any particular nomination with any particular party, so as not to compromise the competitive position of any participants in the process of indicating interest.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">However, please be aware that BOEM's practice is to make all comments, including the names and addresses of individuals, available for public inspection. Before including your address, phone number, email address, or other personal identifying information in your comment, please be advised that your entire comment, including your personal identifying information, may be made publicly available at any time. In order for BOEM to withhold from disclosure your personal identifying information, you must identify any information contained in the submission of your comments that, if released, would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of your personal privacy. You must also briefly describe any possible harmful consequence(s) of the disclosure of information, such as embarrassment, injury or other harm. While you can ask us in your comment to withhold from public review your personal identifying information, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so. BOEM will make available for public inspection, in their entirety, all comments submitted by organizations and businesses, or by individuals identifying themselves as representatives of organizations or businesses.

</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">BDA and SIFMA suggested that the MSRB go beyond the MSRB's stated purpose of the proposed amendments, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> to promote, in part, regulatory consistency among proposed amended Rule G–21 and the advertising rules of other financial regulators. Instead, BDA and SIFMA suggested that the MSRB “harmonize” Rule G–21 with FINRA Rule 2210 by adopting FINRA Rule 2210's definition of “communications” and the distinctions in the rule that follow from that definition. BDA stated that “[i]n order for harmonization of MSRB rules with FINRA rules to be successful, MSRB must follow this general framework for MSRB Rule G–<?page num="21799"?>21.” Further, SIFMA commented that the “MSRB has not justified the need for differences from the FINRA advertising rule.” In particular, commenters favored the harmonization with FINRA Rule 2210's communications definition because institutional communications would no longer be subject to pre-approval by a principal. BDA and SIFMA submitted that, if the MSRB were to do so, dealers then could apply common approval processes for institutional communications across all asset classes. Alternatively, SIFMA suggested that, to provide even greater clarity, the MSRB revise proposed amended Rule G–21(a)(i) and proposed Rule G–40(a)(i) to add the term “otherwise” before the phrase “made generally available to municipal entities, obligated persons, municipal advisory clients or the public . . .” <ref id="fnd2e6307" idref="fnd2e6317" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">88</ref> BDA stated that principal pre-approval of advertisements imposes “completely unnecessary burdens on dealers” and that “[i]f MSRB has a rule that applies different definitions and different sets of responsibilities to municipal securities and does not differentiate between communications sent to retail and institutional customers, it will have created a new and unnecessarily increased regulatory burden along with considerable confusion for broker-dealers.” <ref id="fnd2e6311" idref="fnd2e6325" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">89</ref>

Proposed amended Rule G–21 requires that advertisements be based on the principles of fair dealing and good faith, be fair and balanced, and provide a sound basis for evaluating the facts. A dealer will not be able to omit any material fact or qualification, if the omission, in light of the context of the material presented, would cause the advertisement to be misleading.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Commission believes that proposed Rule G–40 is consistent with the provisions of Section 15B(b)(2)(C) <ref id="fnd2e9038" idref="fnd2e9045" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">306</ref> of the Act because it will help prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices by prohibiting municipal advisors from making any false, exaggerated, unwarranted, promissory or misleading statement or claim in an advertisement. Proposed Rule G–40 requires that advertisements of municipal advisors be based on the principles of fair dealing and good faith, be fair and balanced, and provide a sound basis for municipal entities and obligated persons to evaluate the information presented in such advertisements. A municipal advisor will not be able to omit any material fact or qualification if the omission, in light of the context of the material present, would cause the advertisement to be misleading. Further, the prescriptive nature of proposed Rule G–40 provides guidelines for municipal advisors to follow that would help prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices.

</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Commission also finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15B(b)(2)(L)(iv), in that it does not impose a regulatory burden on small municipal advisors that is not necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors, municipal entities, and obligated persons.<ref id="fnd2e9054" idref="fnd2e9060" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">307</ref> For some one-time initial compliance costs, small municipal advisory firms may incur proportionally larger costs than larger firms. However, for many other ongoing costs, such as costs associated with principal approval and record-keeping requirements, as well as investments in advertisements previously developed but that would no longer be compliant, the costs should be proportionate to the size of the firm. Thus, the Commission believes it is unlikely that proposed Rule G–40 would have an outsized impact on small firms.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Commission believes, through promoting regulatory consistency of certain MSRB advertising standards with those of other financial regulators, proposed amended Rule G–21 may improve efficiency in the form of less unnecessary complexity for dealers and reduced burdens and compliance costs over time, because such additional regulatory consistency should assist dealers with developing uniform policies and procedures. The Commission believes this may also benefit both retail and institutional investors, where transparency, consistency, truthful and accurate information and ease of comparison of different financial services would be highly valued. While dealers may experience increased costs because of the new requirements, these costs should not be significant for dealers also registered with FINRA as much of proposed amended Rule G–21 would align with FINRA Rule 2210. The Commission believes proposed amended Rule G–21 would not impose an unreasonable burden on dealers, and the likely benefits, such as the prevention of fraudulent and manipulative advertising by dealers and the protection of investors, justify such costs.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Commission believes that one benefit of proposed Rule G–40 may be that municipal advisors provide clients more accurate information through advertising, which may lead municipal entities and obligated persons to more informed decision-making when selecting municipal advisors. Furthermore, the Commission believes that as a result of municipal advisor compliance with proposed Rule G–40's advertising standards, municipal entities and obligated persons may be able to more easily establish objective criteria to use in selecting municipal advisors that may increase the likelihood that municipal advisors are hired because of their qualifications as opposed to other reasons. In addition, the Commission believes that transparency, consistency, truthful and accurate information in advertising should benefit municipal entities and obligated persons in general. Although municipal advisors are likely to incur costs associated with compliance with the proposed Rule G–40, the cost would be justified by the likely benefits of the proposed rule, such as the prevention of fraudulent and manipulative advertising by municipal advisors and the protection of municipal entities and obligated persons.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Commission has reviewed the record for the proposed rule change and notes that the record does not contain any information to indicate that the proposed rule change would have a negative effect on capital formation.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As noted above, the Commission received four comment letters on the Notice of Filing. The Commission believes that the MSRB, through its responses and its commitment to provide additional interpretive guidance prior to the effective date of the proposed rule change, has addressed commenters' concerns.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For the reasons noted above, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act.

Cboe Options believes the pilot program has been successful and well received by its Trading Permit Holders and the investing public for the period that it has been in operation as a pilot. In support of the proposed extension of the pilot program, and as required by the pilot program's Approval Order, the Exchange has submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) pilot program reports regarding the pilot, which detail the Exchange's experience with the program.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Exchange believes there is sufficient investor interest and demand in the pilot program to warrant its extension. The Exchange believes that, for the period that the pilot has been in operation, the program has provided investors with additional means of managing their risk exposures and carrying out their investment objectives. Furthermore, the Exchange believes that it has not experienced any adverse market effects with respect to the pilot program, including any adverse market volatility effects that might occur as a result of large FLEX exercises in FLEX Option series that expire near Non-FLEX expirations and use a p.m. settlement (as discussed below).
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In that regard, based on the Exchange's experience in trading FLEX Options to date and over the pilot period, Cboe Options continues to believe that the restrictions on exercise settlement values are no longer necessary to insulate Non-FLEX expirations from the potential adverse market impacts of FLEX expirations.<ref id="fnd2e9341" idref="fnd2e9347" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">13</ref> To the contrary, Cboe Options believes that the restriction actually places the Exchange at a competitive disadvantage to its OTC counterparts in the market for customized options, and unnecessarily limits market participants' ability to trade in an exchange environment that offers the added benefits of transparency, price discovery, liquidity, and financial stability.

The Exchange is not aware of any market disruptions or problems caused by the use of these settlement methodologies on these expiration dates (or on the expiration dates addressed under the pilot program). The Exchange is also not aware of any market disruptions or problems caused by the use of customized options in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) markets that expire on or near Expiration Friday and have a p.m. or specified average exercise settlement value. In addition, the Exchange believes the reasons for limiting expirations to a.m. settlement, which is something the SEC has imposed since the early 1990s for Non-FLEX Options, revolved around a concern about expiration pressure on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) at the close that are no longer relevant in today's market. Today, the Exchange believes stock exchanges are able to better handle volume. There are multiple primary listing and unlisted trading privilege (“UTP”) markets, and trading is dispersed among several exchanges and alternative trading systems. In addition, the Exchange believes that surveillance techniques are much more robust and automated. In the early 1990s, it was also thought by some that opening procedures allow more time to attract contra-side interest to reduce imbalances. The Exchange believes, however, that today, order flow is predominantly electronic and the ability to smooth out openings and closes is greatly reduced (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> market-on-close procedures work just as well as openings). Also, other markets, such as the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, do not have the same type of pre-opening imbalance disseminations as NYSE, so many stocks are not subject to the same procedures on Expiration Friday. In addition, the Exchange believes that NYSE has reduced the required time a specialist has to wait after disseminating a pre-opening indication. So, in this respect, the Exchange believes there is less time to react in the opening than in the close. Moreover, to the extent there may be a risk of adverse market effects attributable to p.m. settled options (or certain average price settled options related to the closing price) that would otherwise be traded in a non-transparent fashion in the OTC market, the Exchange continues to believe that such risk would be lessened by making these customized options eligible for trading in an exchange environment because of the added transparency, price discovery, liquidity, and financial stability available.</p>

Further, the Exchange believes that it has not experienced any adverse effects from the operation of the pilot program, including any adverse market volatility effects that might occur as a result of large FLEX exercises in FLEX Option series that expire near Non-FLEX expirations and use a p.m. settlement. The Exchange also believes that the extension of the exercise settlement values pilot does not raise any unique regulatory concerns. In particular, although p.m. settlements may raise questions with the Commission, the Exchange believes that, based on the Exchange's experience in trading FLEX Options to date and over the pilot period, market impact and investor protection concerns will not be raised by this rule change. The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change would continue to provide Trading Permit Holders and investors with additional opportunities to trade customized options in an exchange environment (which offers the added benefits of transparency, price discovery, liquidity, and financial stability as compared to the over-the-counter market) and subject to exchange-based rules, and investors would benefit as a result.

The Exchange believes that, for the period that the pilot has been in operation, the program has provided investors with additional means of managing their risk exposures and carrying out their investment objectives. Furthermore, the Exchange believes that it has not experienced any adverse market effects with respect to the pilot program, including any adverse market volatility effects that might occur as a result of large FLEX exercises in FLEX Option series that expire near Non-Flex expirations and use a p.m. settlement. Cboe Options believes that the restriction actually places the Exchange at a competitive disadvantage to its OTC counterparts in the market for customized options, and unnecessarily limits market participants' ability to trade in an exchange environment that offers the added benefits of transparency, price discovery, liquidity, and financial stability. Therefore, the Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A determination has been made that a number of foreign persons have engaged in activities that warrant the imposition of measures pursuant to Section 3 of the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act. The Act provides for penalties on foreign entities and individuals for the transfer to or acquisition from Iran since <date date="1999-01-01">January 1, 1999</date>; the transfer to or acquisition from Syria since <date date="2005-01-01">January 1, 2005</date>; or the transfer to or acquisition from North Korea since <date date="2006-01-01">January 1, 2006</date>, of goods, services, or technology controlled under multilateral control lists (Missile Technology Control Regime, Australia Group, Chemical Weapons Convention, Nuclear Suppliers Group, Wassenaar Arrangement) or otherwise having the potential to make a material contribution to the development of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or cruise or ballistic missile systems. The latter category includes items of the same kind as those on multilateral lists but falling below the control list parameters when it is determined that such items have the potential of making a material contribution to WMD or cruise or ballistic missile systems, items on U.S. national control lists for WMD/missile reasons that are not on multilateral lists, and other items with the potential of making such a material contribution when added through case-by-case decisions.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">I. Background
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 135 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (<ref href="/us/usc/t19/s2155">19 U.S.C. 2155</ref>), establishes a private-sector trade advisory system to ensure that U.S. trade policy and trade negotiation objectives adequately reflect U.S. commercial and economic interests. Section 135(c)(2) (<ref href="/us/usc/t19/s2155/c/2">19 U.S.C. 2155(c)(2)</ref>) directs the President to establish sectoral or functional trade advisory committees, as appropriate, including representatives of industry, labor, agriculture, and services, including small business, in the sector or functional area concerned, to provide detailed policy and technical advice, information, and recommendations regarding trade barriers, negotiation of trade agreements, and implementation of existing trade agreements affecting industry sectors, and perform other advisory functions relevant to U.S. trade policy matters as requested.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">II. What do the ITACs do?
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The ITACs provide detailed policy and technical advice, information, and recommendations to the Secretary and the Trade Representative on trade policy matters including: (1) Negotiating objectives and bargaining positions before entering into trade agreements; (2) the impact of the implementation of trade agreements on the relevant sector; (3) matters concerning the operation of any trade agreement once entered into; and (4) other matters arising in connection with the development, implementation, and administration of the trade policy of the United States. The nonpartisan, industry input provided by the ITACs is important in developing unified trade policy objectives and positions when the United States negotiates and implements trade agreements.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The ITACs address market-access problems, trade barriers, tariffs, discriminatory foreign procurement practices, and information, marketing, and advocacy needs of their industry sector. Eleven ITACs (ITACS 1–11) provide advice and information on issues that affect specific sectors of U.S. industry. Three ITACs (ITACs 12–14) focus on crosscutting functional issues that affect all industry sectors and include specifically appointed members along with non-voting members from the industry specific ITACs to represent a broad range of industry perspectives. The ITACs may address other trade policy issues, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> government procurement and subsidies, in ad hoc working groups.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">III. What is the ITAC slate for 2018–2022?
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">When the Trade Representative and the Secretary organize the ITACs, the Trade Act requires that they consult with interested private organizations and consider:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Patterns of actual or potential competition between U.S. industry and agriculture and foreign enterprise in international trade.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• The character of the nontariff barriers and other distortions affecting such competition.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• The necessity for reasonable limits on the number and size of the ITACs.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• That the product lines covered by each ITAC are reasonably related.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Department of Commerce requested comments on proposed changes to the slate of ITACs (<ref href="/us/fr/83/3253">83 FR 3253</ref>) and received 23 written submissions in response. A majority of the responses were a substantially similar letter in opposition to merging ITAC 7 and ITAC 9. A significantly smaller portion advocated against the elimination of the Committee of Chairs.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We have carefully considered these submissions and other factors including the nature of the U.S. industry in various sectors, the level of interest in serving on an ITAC (using the number of members and applications for appointment during the 2014–2018 charter terms), the level of activity of each ITAC (using the number of meetings and recommendations submitted during the 2014–2018 charter <?page num="21814"?>terms), and constraints on the resources to support and engage with the ITACs. We also are renaming ITAC 10 to Services to more accurately reflect the functions of the committee. Based on all of this information, pursuant to section 135(c)(2) of the Trade Act, the Secretary and the Trade Representative have established new four-year charter terms for the following ITACs, that began on <date date="2018-02-14">February 14, 2018</date> and will end on <date date="2022-02-14">February 14, 2022</date>.</p>

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Each ITAC consists of members with experience relevant to the industry sector for ITACs 1 through 11 or the subject area for ITACs 12 through 14. All ITAC members serve in a representative capacity (there are no special government employees (SGEs)) and present the views and interests of a sponsoring U.S. entity or U.S. organization and the entity's or organization's subsector (if applicable). In selecting members, the Secretary and the Trade Representative consider the nominee's ability to carry out the objectives of the ITAC, including knowledge and expertise of the industry and of trade matters relevant to the work of the ITAC, and ensuring that the ITAC is balanced in terms of points of view, demographics, geography, and entity or organization size. Appointments are made without regard to political affiliation.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Secretary and the Trade Representative appoint all ITAC members for a term of four-years or until the ITAC charter expires, and members serve at the discretion of the Secretary and the Trade Representative. Individuals can be reappointed for any number of terms. Appointments are made at the time an ITAC is re-chartered and periodically throughout the four-year charter term. Appointments expire at the end of the charter term, in this case, on <date date="2022-02-14">February 14, 2022</date>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">ITAC members serve without compensation, including reimbursement of expenses. Members are responsible for all expenses they incur to attend meetings or otherwise participate in ITAC activities.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The ITACs meet as needed, depending on various factors such as the level of activity of trade negotiations and the needs of the Secretary and the Trade Representative. On average, each ITAC meet six times a year in Washington, DC.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2017-08-15">August 15, 2017</date>, OMB approved the Quarterly PTC Progress Report (Form FRA F 6180.165) and Annual PTC Progress Report (Form FRA F 6180.166) for a period of one year, expiring on <date date="2018-08-31">August 31, 2018</date>. The current Quarterly PTC Progress Report Form and Annual PTC Progress Report Form, as approved through <date date="2018-08-31">August 31, 2018</date>, can be accessed and downloaded in FRA's eLibrary at: <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.fra.dot.gov/eLib/details/L17365</inline> and <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.fra.dot.gov/eLib/details/L17366,</inline> respectively. These versions of the forms took into account the Association of American Railroads' written comments on behalf of itself and its member railroads; the American Public Transportation Association's written comments on behalf of Northeast Illinois Commuter Rail System, the Utah Transit Authority, the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon, and the Fort Worth Transportation Authority; and industry stakeholders' comments during FRA's public meeting on <date date="2016-04-19">April 19, 2016</date>. FRA published minutes from the meeting on <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">www.regulations.gov</inline> under Docket No. FRA–2016–0002. For a summary of the oral and written comments and FRA's responses to the comments, please see <ref href="/us/fr/81/28140">81 FR 28140</ref>, <date date="2016-05-09">May 9, 2016</date>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Following the 60-day public comment period after this notice is published, FRA will request OMB's re-approval of the forms, with the five changes described below. First, in Section 1 of the Quarterly PTC Progress Report Form (FRA F 6180.165), FRA proposes revising the row “Territories Where Revenue Service Demonstration Has <?page num="21817"?>Been Initiated” to state “Territories in Revenue Service Demonstration or in PTC Operation” for clarity, based on additional feedback from the industry following OMB's approval of the form on <date date="2017-08-15">August 15, 2017</date>. FRA intended this row to include any and all territories where a railroad had initiated revenue service demonstration (RSD), even if a railroad subsequently obtained PTC System Certification from FRA and is operating its PTC system in revenue service. The purpose of this row is to collect information regarding a railroad's progress toward meeting the statutory criteria under <ref href="/us/usc/t49/s20157/a/3/B/vi">49 U.S.C. 20157(a)(3)(B)(vi)</ref>–(vii), if applicable. Based on feedback from the industry, FRA proposes clarifying the language in this row in Section 1 so railroads understand that a railroad can include in this row the number of territories where its PTC system is in RSD or in operation. This proposed change does not result in any additional reporting burden as it is only a clarifying change.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Second, in footnotes 4 and 6 of the Quarterly PTC Progress Report Form (FRA F 6180.165), FRA proposes adding a hyperlink to Appendix A. The footnotes currently state: “If a particular category listed in this table does not apply to the railroad's technology, please indicate `N/A.' A railroad may add categories or subcategories if it wants to provide more detail.” FRA proposes adding the phrase “in Appendix A” to the second sentence with a hyperlink to that appendix to the form, as it will help direct railroads to the available section of the PDF where they can provide additional information. A hyperlink to Appendix A was in the corresponding footnotes in the prior version of the Quarterly PTC Progress Report Form that OMB approved through <date date="2017-06-30">June 30, 2017</date>, but the hyperlink was omitted in error from the current version of the form. This proposed change (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> adding a hyperlink to an existing appendix) does not result in any additional reporting burden as it is only a formatting change.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Third, in Section 4 (entitled “Installation/Track Segment Progress—Current Status”) of both the quarterly form and the annual form, FRA proposes replacing the “Testing” option in the drop-down menu with two more precise options—<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> “Field Testing” and “Revenue Service Demonstration.” This modification will help ensure clearer and more accurate reporting, without imposing an additional reporting burden.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Fourth, with respect to only the Annual PTC Progress Report Form (FRA F 6180.166), FRA proposes to delete a now inapplicable instruction from footnote 7 in Section 4, which stated,

Every other part of this form must be completed and submitted to FRA by <date date="2017-03-31">March 31, 2017</date>. This limited extension applies only in 2017.

                                       <?GPOvSpace 04?>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FRA delayed the due date for submitting that specific information in 2017 only, per OMB's request, to ensure railroads had sufficient time to compile and provide the information. FRA proposes removing that note from footnote 7 as it is no longer applicable or necessary. By statute, a railroad's Annual PTC Progress Report is due by March 31st each year. <ref href="/us/usc/t49/s20157/c/1">49 U.S.C. 20157(c)(1)</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Fifth, with respect to both the quarterly form and the annual form, FRA proposes making certain changes to Section 6 (entitled “Update on Interoperability Progress”). FRA proposes removing the portion of the instruction that states a host railroad must provide information about the status of each tenant railroad's rolling stock “if the tenant does not have a separate PTCIP on file.” FRA proposes removing this limiting instruction because FRA needs to know the PTC implementation status of any tenant railroad that operates on the host railroad's property, except any tenant railroad that is subject to an exception under <ref href="/us/cfr/t49/s236.1006/b">49 CFR 236.1006(b)</ref>. In addition, before the final column in the table in Section 6, FRA proposes adding a column entitled, “Scheduled Completion Date for Interoperability Testing.” This information is necessary for FRA to understand the progress a host railroad and each of its required tenant railroads are jointly making toward testing and achieving PTC system interoperability, consistent with host railroad's PTC Implementation Plan and/or PTC Safety Plan. FRA estimates the additional burden for a host railroad to complete this new reporting requirement would be, on average, approximately 2.5 hours for Class I railroads and large passenger railroads; 1.25 hours for Class II and medium passenger railroads; and thirty minutes for Class III, terminal, and small passenger railroads.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The abuse potential of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl is associated with its pharmacological similarity to other schedule I and II mu-opioid receptor agonist substances which have a high potential for abuse. Similar to morphine, fentanyl and several schedule I opioid substances that are structurally related to fentanyl, beta-hydroxythiofentanyl has been shown to bind and act as a μ-opioid receptor agonist.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">beta-Hydroxythiofentanyl has no approved medical use in the United States and has been encountered on the illicit drug market. The use of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl has been associated with adverse outcomes to include death. Because beta-hydroxythiofentanyl is not an approved drug product, a practitioner may not legally prescribe it, and this substance cannot be dispensed to an individual. Therefore, the use of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl is without medical advice, and accordingly, leads to the conclusion that beta-hydroxythiofentanyl is abused for its opioidergic properties. There are no legitimate drug channels for beta-hydroxythiofentanyl as a marketed drug product but it's available for purchase from legitimate chemical companies because it is used in scientific research. However, despite the limited legitimate use of this substance, reports from public health and law enforcement communicate that beta-hydroxythiofentanyl is being abused and taken in amounts sufficient to create a hazard to an individual's health. This is evidenced by the positive toxicological identification of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl in several (n=25) overdose deaths. Data from forensic databases can be used as an indicator of illicit activity with drugs and abuse <ref id="fnd5e247" idref="fnd5e257" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">5</ref> within the United States. According to the National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS) <ref id="fnd5e251" idref="fnd5e265" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">6</ref> which collects and analyzes drug exhibits submitted to Federal, State and Local forensic laboratories, there were ten reports (from Florida) of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl within this database in 2015. Consequently, the positive identification of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl in law enforcement encounters and toxicological screenings of overdose deaths indicates that this substance is being abused, and thus poses safety hazards to the health of users.

The abuse potential (assessed by drug discriminative study and self-administration study) of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl has not been studied in non-clinical or clinical studies, however the non-clinical and clinical studies conducted on abuse potential of mu-opioid receptor agonists such as morphine and fentanyl indicate that these drugs share discriminative stimulus effects and that these drugs have reinforcing properties. Similar to schedule I and II opioid analgesics, beta-hydroxythiofentanyl binds to and activates the mu-opioid receptor. Additionally, behavioral studies in animals demonstrate that similar to fentanyl and morphine, beta-hydroxythiofentanyl produces analgesic effect. Pre-treatment with naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, attenuated analgesic effects of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl, fentanyl and morphine. These data indicate that beta-hydroxythiofentanyl is a CNS active mu-opioid receptor agonist that is about 10 times more potent than morphine. Thus, it is concluded from <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">in vitro</inline> and <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">in vivo</inline> pharmacological studies that effects of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl are similar to that of fentanyl and morphine and is mediated by mu-opioid receptor agonism.

The chemical structure of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl differs in substitution from fentanyl at the piperidine nitrogen atom. Fentanyl contains a phenyl ethyl group at the piperidine nitrogen atom whereas beta-hydroxythiofentanyl is substituted with a beta-hydroxy 2-thienyl ethyl group. Also, beta-hydroxythiofentanyl structurally differs from the schedule I synthetic opioid, thiofentanyl, by the addition of a hydroxyl group at the beta-position of the thienyl ethyl group. Data from postmortem toxicological analysis show that a fentanyl metabolite, norfentanyl, was detected in one case that involved beta-hydroxythiofentanyl. No study has been undertaken to evaluate the efficacy, toxicology, and safety of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl in humans. It can be inferred from medical examiner reports and data obtained from animal studies that beta-hydroxythiofentanyl has sufficient distribution to the brain to produce depressant effects similar to that of mu opioid receptor agonists.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">There is no FDA approved marketing application for a drug product containing beta-hydroxythiofentanyl for any therapeutic indication in the United States. Moreover, there are no clinical studies or petitioners of which has claimed an accepted medical use in the United States for this substance.

Evidence suggests that the pattern of abuse of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl parallels that of prescription opioid analgesics. Beta-hydroxythiofentanyl, like other substances structurally related to fentanyl is disguised as a “legal” alternative to fentanyl. There is evidence that beta-hydroxythiofentanyl is ingested with other substances. beta-Hydroxythiofentanyl has been identified in pills, presumably intended for sale on the illicit market.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">5. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">The Scope, Duration, and Significance of Abuse:</inline> beta-Hydroxythiofentanyl, similar to other substances structurally related to fentanyl, is a recreational drug. The recreational use of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl and other substances related to fentanyl continues to be of significant concern in the United States. These substances are distributed to users, often with unpredictable outcomes. Because users of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl and its associated drug products are likely to obtain these substances through unregulated sources, the identity, purity, and quantity are uncertain and inconsistent, thus posing significant adverse health risks to abusers. The significance of abuse for beta-hydroxythiofentanyl is reflected in the positive identification of this substance in several post-mortem cases. Though the scope and duration of abuse data for beta-hydroxythiofentanyl were restricted to Florida in 2015, there is the possibility the number of fatalities were underreported because the capabilities of medical examiner offices across the country vary and many are unable to detect beta-hydroxythiofentanyl in their toxicological screens. Evidence that beta-hydroxythiofentanyl is being abused and trafficked is confirmed by law enforcement encounters. NFLIS contained ten reports of beta-<?page num="21829"?>hydroxythiofentanyl from Florida from State, local, and other forensic laboratories. These data demonstrate that beta-hydroxythiofentanyl has significance of abuse that supports its scheduling under the CSA.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Currently the United States is in the midst of a prescription and illicit opioid abuse epidemic. According to NFLIS, in the last few years, there has been marked increase in the encounters of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and substances that are structurally related to fentanyl. In parallel to this increase in law enforcement encounters, there has been a corresponding marked increase in deaths related to synthetic opioids. beta-Hydroxythiofentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is structurally related to fentanyl. Therefore, the issue of fentanyl and substances structurally related to fentanyl abuse has become a major public health problem.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">6. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">What, if Any, Risk There is to the Public Health:</inline> Available evidence on the overall public health risks associated with the use of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl is reflected by the several cases of fatalities (n=25) associated with its abuse. In addition to the recognized harm from ingesting beta-hydroxythiofentanyl, abusers risk harm when they obtain these drugs through unknown sources. Since beta-hydroxythiofentanyl shares a similar pharmacological profile with fentanyl and other opioid analgesics, individuals who abuse this substance are likely at risk of developing substance use disorder, overdose and death similar to other opioid analgesics. Further, poly-substance abuse has been identified in fatalities involving fentanyl and other related opioids. In reported fatality cases involving beta-hydroxythiofentanyl, other substances such as cocaine, ethanol, other opioids, cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, and stimulants were also co-identified in the toxicological screening. Evidence suggests that products containing fentanyl related substances often do not bear accurate information regarding their contents and if they do, they may not contain the expected active ingredients or identify the health risks and potential hazards associated with these products. Thus, the limited knowledge about product contents, its purity and lack of information about its effects may pose another level of risk to users. Taken together, evidence posits that individuals experimenting with substances with unknown potency are at high risk of adverse health outcomes.

Opioid withdrawal includes nausea and vomiting, depression, agitation, anxiety, craving, sweats, hypertension, diarrhea, and fever.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Administrator, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s601–602">5 U.S.C. 601–602</ref>, has reviewed this proposed rule and by approving it, certifies that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. On <date date="2016-05-12">May 12, 2016</date>, the DEA published a final order to temporarily place beta-hydroxythiofentanyl in schedule I of the CSA pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/h">21 U.S.C. 811(h)</ref>. The DEA estimates that all entities handling or planning to handle beta-hydroxythiofentanyl have already established and implemented the systems and processes required to handle this substances. There are currently 15 registrations authorized to handle beta-hydroxythiofentanyl, as well as a number of registered analytical labs that are authorized to handle schedule I controlled substances generally. These 15 registrations represent 13 entities, of which 10 are small entities. Therefore, the DEA estimates 10 small entities are affected by this proposed rule.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A review of the 15 registrations indicates that all entities that currently handle beta-hydroxythiofentanyl also handle other schedule I controlled substances, and have established and implemented (or maintain) the systems and processes required to handle beta-hydroxythiofentanyl. Therefore, the DEA anticipates that this proposed rule will impose minimal or no economic impact on any affected entities; and thus, will not have a significant economic impact on any of the 10 affected small entities. Therefore, the DEA has concluded that this proposed rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In accordance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) of 1995, <ref href="/us/usc/t2/s1501">2 U.S.C. 1501</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.,</inline> the DEA has determined and certifies that this action would not result in any Federal mandate that may result “in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or more (adjusted for inflation) in any one year * * *.” Therefore, neither a Small Government Agency Plan nor any other action is required under UMRA of 1995.

That final order was effective on the date of publication, and was based on findings by the Acting Administrator of the DEA that the temporary scheduling of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl was necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety pursuant to <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/h/1">21 U.S.C. 811(h)(1)</ref>. Section 201(h)(2) of the CSA, <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/h/2">21 U.S.C. 811(h)(2)</ref>, requires that the temporary control of this substance expires two years from the effective date of the scheduling order, or on <date date="2018-05-12">May 12, 2018</date>. However, the CSA also provides that during the pendency of proceedings under <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/a/1">21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1)</ref> with respect to the substance, the temporary scheduling <ref id="fnd7e100" idref="fnd7e111" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref> of that substance could be extended for up to one year. Proceedings for the scheduling of a substance under <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/a">21 U.S.C. 811(a)</ref> may be initiated by the Attorney General (delegated to the Administrator of the DEA pursuant to <ref href="/us/cfr/t28/s0.100">28 CFR 0.100</ref>) on his own motion, at the request of the Secretary of Health and Human Services,<ref id="fnd7e104" idref="fnd7e116" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">2</ref> or on the petition of any interested party.

The DEA has gathered and reviewed the available information regarding the pharmacology, chemistry, trafficking, actual abuse, pattern of abuse, and the relative potential for abuse for this substance. On <date date="2016-12-08">December 8, 2016</date>, the DEA submitted a request to the HHS to provide the DEA with a scientific and medical evaluation of available information and a scheduling recommendation for butyryl fentanyl and beta-hydroxythiofentanyl, and in accordance with <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/b">21 U.S.C. 811(b)</ref> and (c). In a letter dated <date date="2017-11-01">November 1, 2017</date>, DEA notified HHS that it no longer required a scientific and medical evaluation for butyryl fentanyl because the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND), at its 60th session, added butyryl fentanyl to Schedule I of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961. On <date date="2018-04-20">April 20, 2018</date>, the DEA published a final scheduling order for butyryl fentanyl (83 FR17486) to meet international treaty obligations pursuant to <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/d/1">21 U.S.C. 811(d)(1)</ref>.

Upon receipt of the scientific and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation from the HHS, the DEA reviewed the documents and all other relevant data, and conducted its own eight-factor analysis of the abuse potential of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl in accordance with <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/c">21 U.S.C. 811(c)</ref>. The DEA published a notice of proposed rulemaking for the placement of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl in schedule I elsewhere in this issue of the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>. If this order is made permanent, the DEA will publish a final rule in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Regulatory Matters
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The CSA provides for an expedited temporary scheduling action where such action is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/h">21 U.S.C. 811(h)</ref>. The Attorney General may, by order, schedule a substance in schedule I on a temporary basis. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/h">21 U.S.C. 811(h)</ref> also provides that the temporary scheduling of a substance shall expire at the end of two years from the date of the issuance of the order scheduling such substance, except that the Attorney General may, during the pendency of proceedings to permanently schedule the substance, extend the temporary scheduling for up to one year.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">To the extent that <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/h">21 U.S.C. 811(h)</ref> directs that temporary scheduling actions be issued by order and sets forth the procedures by which such orders are to be issued and extended, the DEA believes that the notice and comment requirements of section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553">5 U.S.C. 553</ref>, do not apply to this <?page num="21835"?>extension of the temporary scheduling action. In the alternative, even assuming that this action might be subject to section 553 of the APA, the Acting Administrator finds that there is good cause to forgo the notice and comment requirements of section 553, as any further delays in the process for extending the temporary scheduling order would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest in view of the manifest urgency to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. Further, the DEA believes that this order extending the temporary scheduling action is not a “rule” as defined by <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s601/2">5 U.S.C. 601(2)</ref>, and, accordingly, is not subject to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA). The requirements for the preparation of an initial regulatory flexibility analysis in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s603/a">5 U.S.C. 603(a)</ref> are not applicable where, as here, the DEA is not required by section 553 of the APA or any other law to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Additionally, this action is not a significant regulatory action as defined by <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref> (Regulatory Planning and Review), section 3(f), and, accordingly, this action has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This action will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with <ref href="/us/eo/13132">Executive Order 13132</ref> (Federalism) it is determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As noted above, this action is an order, not a rule. Accordingly, the Congressional Review Act (CRA) is inapplicable, as it applies only to rules. However, if this were a rule, pursuant to the CRA, “any rule for which an agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, shall take effect at such time as the federal agency promulgating the rule determines.” <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s808/2">5 U.S.C. 808(2)</ref>. It is in the public interest to maintain the temporary placement of beta-hydroxythiofentanyl in schedule I because it poses a public health risk. The temporary scheduling action was taken pursuant to <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/h">21 U.S.C. 811(h)</ref>, which is specifically designed to enable the DEA to act in an expeditious manner to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. Under <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/h">21 U.S.C. 811(h)</ref>, temporary scheduling orders are not subject to notice and comment rulemaking procedures. The DEA understands that the CSA frames temporary scheduling actions as orders rather than rules to ensure that the process moves swiftly, and this extension of the temporary scheduling order continues to serve that purpose. For the same reasons that underlie <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/h">21 U.S.C. 811(h)</ref>, that is, the need to place this substance in schedule I because it poses an imminent hazard to public safety, it would be contrary to the public interest to delay implementation of this extension of the temporary scheduling order. Therefore, in accordance with section 808(2) of the CRA, this order extending the temporary scheduling order shall take effect immediately upon its publication. The DEA has submitted a copy of this temporary order to both Houses of Congress and to the Comptroller General, although such filing is not required under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Congressional Review Act), <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s801–808">5 U.S.C. 801–808</ref> because, as noted above, this action is an order, not a rule.

</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:FP">On <date date="2004-05-11">May 11, 2004</date>, pursuant to his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, <ref href="/us/usc/t50/s1701–1706">50 U.S.C. 1701–1706</ref>, and the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, <ref href="/us/pl/108/175">Public Law 108–175</ref>, the President issued <ref href="/us/eo/13338">Executive Order 13338</ref>, in which he declared a national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. To deal with this national emergency, <ref href="/us/eo/13338">Executive Order 13338</ref> authorized the blocking of property of certain persons and prohibited the exportation or reexportation of certain goods to Syria. The national emergency was modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in <ref href="/us/eo/13399">Executive Order 13399</ref> of <date date="2006-04-25">April 25, 2006</date>, <ref href="/us/eo/13460">Executive Order 13460</ref> of <date date="2008-02-13">February 13, 2008</date>, <ref href="/us/eo/13572">Executive Order 13572</ref> of <date date="2011-04-29">April 29, 2011</date>, <ref href="/us/eo/13573">Executive Order 13573</ref> of <date date="2011-05-18">May 18, 2011</date>, <ref href="/us/eo/13582">Executive Order 13582</ref> of <date date="2011-08-17">August 17, 2011</date>, <ref href="/us/eo/13606">Executive Order 13606</ref> of <date date="2012-04-22">April 22, 2012</date>, and <ref href="/us/eo/13608">Executive Order 13608</ref> of <date date="2012-05-01">May 1, 2012</date>.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:FP">The President took these actions to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions of the Government of Syria in supporting terrorism, maintaining its then-existing occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and undermining United States and international efforts with respect to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:FP">The regime's brutality and repression of the Syrian people, who have been calling for freedom and a representative government, not only endangers the Syrian people themselves, but also generates instability throughout the region. The Syrian regime's actions and policies, including with respect to chemical weapons, supporting terrorist organizations, and obstructing the Lebanese government's ability to function effectively, continue to foster the rise of extremism and sectarianism and pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency declared on <date date="2004-05-11">May 11, 2004</date>, and the measures to deal with that emergency adopted on that date in <ref href="/us/eo/13338">Executive Order 13338</ref>; on <date date="2006-04-25">April 25, 2006</date>, in <ref href="/us/eo/13399">Executive Order 13399</ref>; on <date date="2008-02-13">February 13, 2008</date>, in <ref href="/us/eo/13460">Executive Order 13460</ref>; on <date date="2011-04-29">April 29, 2011</date>, in <ref href="/us/eo/13572">Executive Order 13572</ref>; on <date date="2011-05-18">May 18, 2011</date>, in <ref href="/us/eo/13573">Executive Order 13573</ref>; on <date date="2011-08-17">August 17, 2011</date>, in <ref href="/us/eo/13582">Executive Order 13582</ref>; on <date date="2012-04-22">April 22, 2012</date>, in <ref href="/us/eo/13606">Executive Order 13606</ref>; and on <date date="2012-05-01">May 1, 2012</date>, in <ref href="/us/eo/13608">Executive Order 13608</ref>, must continue in effect beyond <date date="2018-05-11">May 11, 2018</date>. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, <ref href="/us/usc/t50/s1622/d">50 U.S.C. 1622(d)</ref>, I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:FP">In addition, the United States condemns the Assad regime's use of brutal violence and human rights abuses and calls on the Assad regime to stop its violence against the Syrian people, uphold the Cessation of Hostilities, enable the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and allow a political transition in Syria that will forge a credible path to a future of greater freedom, democracy, opportunity, and justice.</p>
