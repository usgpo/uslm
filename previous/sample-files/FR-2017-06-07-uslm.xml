</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2016-06-03">June 3, 2016</date>, the Agency published a final rule for the Business and Industry (B&amp;I) Guaranteed Loan Program (<ref href="/us/fr/81/35984">81 FR 35984</ref>). Since then, the Agency has discovered the need for a correction to the regulation regarding provisions relating to the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program.



</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The preamble of the final rule publication noted that the rule has been expanded to include a lender's leveraged loan to accommodate the mechanics of the NMTC program. The Agency has received comments from many practitioners of the NMTC program that the Agency has incorrectly stated in § 4279.116(b) that a “sub-CDE” is the borrower in a leveraged equity transaction for the NMTC program. A NMTC sub-CDE is not a borrowing entity; it is a lending entity established for a single specific NMTC investment. The correct borrower in the mechanics of a leveraged equity NMTC transaction is an investor fund entity owned by a NMTC investor and a leveraged lender, which has been established for a single specific NMTC project. The investor fund entity makes a qualified equity investment to the sub-CDE that in turn provides loans to an eligible business. To correct this error and accommodate the mechanics of a leveraged equity transaction within the NMTC program, the Agency is replacing the word “sub-CDE,” with the words “investor fund entity” as it relates to an eligible borrowing entity.

In that action, the FAA amended Class E Airspace at Grant County International Airport, Moses Lake, WA, and Olympia Regional Airport, Olympia, WA. The FAA has determined that withdrawal of the final rule, technical amendment is warranted since a change in the geographic coordinates of the airports will affect the charted boundaries of the airspace, and therefore should be considered under the full rulemaking process.

Additionally, the action updated the geographic coordinates of Grant County International Airport, and Fairchild AFB, as listed in the Grant County International Airport Class D and Class E legal descriptions. The FAA found that by updating the geographic coordinates of the airports, the charted boundaries of the airspace were affected sufficiently to warrant full consideration under the rulemaking process. As a result, the final rule, technical amendment is being withdrawn.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is found in <ref href="/us/usc/t49">Title 49 of the United States Code</ref>. Subtitle I, Section 106 describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's authority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that authority as it modifies the air traffic service route structure in the eastern United States to maintain the efficient flow of air traffic.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This final rule amends <ref href="/us/cfr/t14">Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations</ref> (14 CFR) part 71 by modifying VOR Federal airways V–16, V–94 and V–124, due to the planned decommissioning of the Jacks Creek, TN, VOR/DME. The route changes are described below.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">V–16: V–16 extends between Los Angeles, CA, and Boston, MA. This action amends that portion of the route that reads “. . .Marvell, AR; Holly Springs, MS; Jacks Creek, TN; Shelbyville, TN. . ..” to read as follows: “. . .Marvell, AR; to Holly Springs, MS. From Shelbyville, TN;. . ..” thus eliminating Jacks Creek, TN, from the route.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">V–94: V–94 extends between Blythe, CA and Bowling Green, KY. This action terminates the route at Holly Springs, MS, thus eliminating the segments of the route from Holly Springs, MS, through Jacks Creek, TN, to Bowling Green, KY.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">V–124: V–124 extends between Bonham, TX and Graham, TN. This action terminates the route at Gilmore, AR, thus eliminating the segments from Gilmore, AR, through Jacks Creek, TN, to Graham, TN.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>; (2) is not a “significant rule” under Department of Transportation (DOT) Regulatory Policies and Procedures (<ref href="/us/fr/44/11034">44 FR 11034</ref>; <date date="1979-02-26">February 26, 1979</date>); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation because the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that only affects air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Environmental Review
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FAA has determined that this action of modifying VOR Federal airways V–16, V–94 and V–124 in the eastern United States due to the planned decommissioning of the Jacks Creek, TN, VOR/DME navigation aid qualifies for categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act and its agency-specific implementing regulations in FAA Order 1050.1F, “Environmental Impacts: Policies and Procedures” regarding categorical exclusions for procedural actions at paragraph 5–6.5a, which categorically excludes from full environmental impact review rulemaking actions that designate or modify classes of airspace areas, airways, routes, and reporting points. Therefore, this airspace action is not expected to result in any significant environmental impacts. In accordance with FAA Order 1050.1F, paragraph 5–2 regarding Extraordinary Circumstances, this action has been reviewed for factors and circumstances in which a normally categorically excluded action may have a significant environmental impact requiring further analysis, and it is determined that no extraordinary circumstances exist that warrant preparation of an environmental assessment.

In that action, the FAA amended Class E Airspace at Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport, Lewiston, ID; Pocatello Regional Airport, Pocatello, ID; and Joslin Field-Magic Valley Regional Airport, Twin Falls, ID. The FAA has determined that withdrawal of the final rule, technical amendment is warranted since a change in the geographic coordinates of the airports will affect the charted boundaries of the airspace, and therefore should be considered under the full rulemaking process.

Additionally, the action updated the geographic coordinates of these airports and the Pocatello VHF Omnidirectional Radar Range Tactical Air Navigation Aid (VORTAC), the Twin Falls VORTAC, and American Falls Airport listed in the associated Class D and Class E airspace descriptions for Pocatello Regional Airport, and Joslin Field-Magic Valley Regional Airport.

The final rule entered into effect on <date date="2015-06-09">June 9, 2015</date>. At that time, NOAA postponed the effectiveness of the discharge requirements in both sanctuaries' regulations in the areas added to GFNMS and CBNMS boundaries in 2015 with regard to U.S. Coast Guard activities for six months. Since then, NOAA published three documents to extend the postponement of the discharge requirements to provide adequate time for completion of an environmental assessment, and subsequent rulemaking, as appropriate. The current extension would end on <date date="2017-06-09">June 9, 2017</date>. This document extends the postponement of the discharge requirements for these activities for another six months for the same reasons.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2015-03-12">March 12, 2015</date>, NOAA expanded the boundaries of Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (now renamed Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary or GFNMS) and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBNMS) to an area north and west of their previous boundaries with a final rule (<ref href="/us/fr/80/13078">80 FR 13078</ref>). The final rule entered into effect on <date date="2015-06-09">June 9, 2015</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/80/34047">80 FR 34047</ref>). In the course of the rulemaking to expand GFNMS and CBNMS, NOAA learned from U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) that the discharge regulations had the potential to impair the operations of USCG vessels and aircraft conducting law enforcement and on-water training exercises in GFNMS and CBNMS expansion areas. The USCG supports national marine sanctuary management by providing routine surveillance and dedicated law enforcement of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) and sanctuary regulations. To ensure that the <date date="2015-03-12">March 12, 2015</date>, rule did not undermine USCG's ability to perform its duties, at that time, NOAA postponed the effectiveness of the discharge requirements in both sanctuaries' regulations with regard to USCG activities in the expansion areas for six months. Three additional six-month postponements of the effectiveness of the discharge requirements were published in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> on <date date="2015-12-01">December 1, 2015</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/80/74985">80 FR 74985</ref>), <date date="2016-05-31">May 31, 2016</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/81/34268">81 FR 34268</ref>), and <date date="2016-12-06">December 6, 2016</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/81/87803">81 FR 87803</ref>), to provide adequate time for completion of an environmental assessment and to determine NOAA's next steps. Without further NOAA action, the discharge regulations would become effective with regard to USCG activities on <date date="2017-06-09">June 9, 2017</date>. However, NOAA needs more time to develop alternatives for an environmental assessment developed pursuant to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. Therefore, this document postpones the effectiveness of the discharge requirements in the expansion areas of both sanctuaries with regard to USCG activities for another six months, until <date date="2017-12-09">December 9, 2017</date>. During this time, NOAA will continue to consider how to address USCG's concerns and, among other things, whether to exempt certain USCG activities in sanctuary regulations. The public, other federal agencies, and interested stakeholders will be given an opportunity to comment on various alternatives that are being considered. This will include the opportunity to review any proposed rule and related environmental analysis.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NOAA previously conducted an environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as part of the rulemaking process leading to the expansion of CBNMS and GFNMS, which addressed regulations regarding the discharge of any matter or material in the sanctuaries. Potential environmental impacts of the decision to postpone effectiveness are sufficiently encompassed within the impacts analysis of the environmental baseline and the no action alternative presented in that analysis. Should NOAA decide to amend the regulations governing discharges for USGS activities in CBNMS and GFNMS, any additional environmental analysis required under NEPA would be prepared and released for public comment.

This action postpones the effectiveness of the discharge requirements in the regulations for CBNMS and GFNMS in the areas added to the sanctuaries' boundaries in 2015 (subject to notice and comment review) with regard to USCG activities for six months to provide adequate time for public scoping, completion of an environmental assessment, and subsequent rulemaking, as appropriate. Should NOAA decide to amend the regulations governing discharges in CBNMS and GFNMS, it would publish a proposed rule followed by an appropriate public comment period as required by the APA. The substance of the underlying regulations remains unchanged. Therefore, providing notice and opportunity for public comment under the APA would serve no useful purpose. The delay in effectiveness provided by this action will also enable NOAA to fully implement its statutory responsibilities under the NMSA to protect resources of a national marine sanctuary. For the reasons above, the Assistant Administrator also finds good cause under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/d">5 U.S.C. 553(d)</ref> to waive the 30-day delay in effectiveness and make this action effective immediately upon publication.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This final rule amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect the extension of import restrictions on certain archaeological and ethnological materials from Peru. The restrictions, which were originally imposed by Treasury Decision (T.D.) 97–50 and last extended by CBP Dec. 12–11, are due to expire on <date date="2017-06-09">June 9, 2017</date>, unless extended. The Acting Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has determined that conditions continue to warrant the imposition of import restrictions. The Designated List of archaeological and ethnological materials described in T.D. 97–50 is revised in this document to reflect the addition of Colonial period documents and manuscripts. Accordingly, the restrictions will remain in effect for an additional 5 years, and the CBP regulations are being amended to indicate this fourth extension. These restrictions are being extended pursuant to determinations of the United States Department of State made under the terms of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, which implements the 1970 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">These heads have had the bones removed and then have been cured to shrink them. They are recognizable because they conserve all the traits of the original skin, including hair and hair follicles. The mouth is sewn shut and generally there are carrying cords attached. There may be an obvious seam to repair the cuts made when the skin was removed from the skull. Finally, the skin is thick (up to 2.5 mm.) and has a dark color. Trophy heads vary between 9.5 cm. and 15.5 cm. in height.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">False shrunken heads can be recognized because they are made of the skin of a mammal, with some of the fur left where the human hair would be. The skin is first smoked, then pressed into a mold to give it a face-like shape. The eyes, nose, mouth and ears are simple bumps without real holes. Further, the skin is very thin and yellowish in color. Often the “heads” have eyebrows and moustaches formed by leaving some of the animal hair, but these features are grotesque because they appear to grow upside down.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Description: These textiles are characterized by the cut of the cloth, with the four borders or selvages finished on the same loom. Clothes are untailored and made from smaller pieces of convenient sizes which were then sewn together. Colonial indigenous textiles of the period are differentiated from pre-Columbian textiles primarily by their decoration: Western motifs such as lions, heraldic emblems, and Spanish personages are incorporated into the designs; sometimes fibers distinct from cotton or wool (threads of silver, gold, and silk) are woven into the cloth; and the colors tend to be more vivid because the fabrics were made more recently. Another important characteristic of the clothing is the presence of tocapus or horizontal bands of small squares with anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, phytomorphic and geometric ideographs and designs. Characteristic textiles include:

L. 114–255</ref>) was signed into law, amending certain provisions of the FD&amp;C Act. FDA is updating regulations to reflect some of those <?page num="26349"?>changes that are now in effect. Specifically, section 3052 of the 21st Century Cures Act amended section 520(m) of the FD&amp;C Act to allow for HDE approval for devices that, among other things, treat or diagnose a disease or condition that affects “not more than 8,000” individuals in the United States; this threshold had been “fewer than 4,000” individuals in the United States (amending <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s360j/m">21 U.S.C. 360j(m)</ref>, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">passim</inline>). This final rule amends part 814 (<ref href="/us/cfr/t21/p814">21 CFR part 814</ref>) in several places to accurately reflect the threshold recently enacted into law.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, section 3056 of the 21st Century Cures Act amended section 520 of the FD&amp;C Act to remove the requirement for institutional review committees, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> IRBs, for devices to be “local”, (amending <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s360j">21 U.S.C. 360j</ref>, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">passim</inline>). This final rule amends <ref href="/us/cfr/t21/s814.124/a">21 CFR 814.124(a)</ref>, “IRB approval”, to remove the term “local” and related language in order to accurately reflect the requirements recently enacted into law.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FDA finds good cause for issuing this amendment as a final rule without notice and comment because this amendment only updates the implementing regulation to restate the statute in light of amendments recently enacted into law (see <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)</ref>, relating to notice and comment procedures): “[W]hen regulations merely restate the statute they implement, notice-and-comment procedures are unnecessary”. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Gray Panthers Advocacy Committee</inline> v. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Sullivan,</inline> 936 F.2d 1284, 1291 (D.C.

Safety Bd.,</inline> 832 F.2d 1294, 1296 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (when a rule “does no more than repeat, virtually verbatim, the statutory grant of authority”, notice-and-comment procedures are not required). Therefore, we are issuing these amendments as a final rule, and publication of this document constitutes final action on this change under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553">5 U.S.C. 553</ref>).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, FDA finds good cause for these amendments to become effective on the date of publication of this action. The APA allows an effective date less than 30 days after publication as “provided by the agency for good cause found and published with the rule” (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/d/3">5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)</ref>). A delayed effective date is unnecessary in this case because the new requirements are already effective as a matter of law. Furthermore, this rule does not establish additional regulatory obligations or impose additional burden on regulated entities. As a result, affected parties do not need time to prepare before the rule takes effect. Therefore, FDA finds good cause for these amendments to become effective on the date of publication of this action.

In addition, a HUD may be administered only if such use has been approved by an IRB. If, however, a physician in an emergency situation determines that approval from an IRB cannot be obtained in time to prevent serious harm or death to a patient, a HUD may be administered without prior approval by an IRB. In such an emergency situation, the physician shall, within 5 days after the use of the device, provide written notification to the chairman of the IRB of such use. Such written notification shall include the identification of the patient involved, the date on which the device was used, and the reason for the use.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2016-05-17">May 17, 2016</date>, the Secretary-General of the United Nations advised the Secretary of State of the United States, that during the 59th session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, acetyl fentanyl was added to schedule I of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961. This letter was prompted by a decision at the 59th session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in March 2016 to schedule acetyl fentanyl under schedule I of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. As a signatory Member State to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the United States is obligated to control acetyl fentanyl under its national drug control legislation, the CSA, in the schedule deemed most appropriate to carry out its international obligations. <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/d/1">21 U.S.C. 811(d)(1)</ref>.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Acetyl Fentanyl
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2015-07-17">July 17, 2015</date>, acetyl fentanyl was temporarily placed in schedule I of the CSA in order to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety (<ref href="/us/fr/80/42381">80 FR 42381</ref>). Acetyl fentanyl is a potent opioid analgesic and has no accepted medical use in the United States. Since 2013, both law enforcement (DEA's NFLIS and STARLiMS databases) and public health reports demonstrate the unregulated use and distribution of this substance. Law enforcement reports indicate that acetyl fentanyl is available on the illicit market as a powder or in tablet form which mimic pharmaceutical opiate products. In powder form, the identity of the substance may go unknown to the end user as it may be marketed as heroin or mixed with heroin. Recent reports indicate that acetyl fentanyl is available over the Internet.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Acetyl fentanyl exhibits a typical morphine-like profile in animals. Data from the scientific literature show that the analgesic potency of acetyl fentanyl is up to 15.7 times greater than that of morphine in mice as evaluated using an acetic acid writhing method. Since 2013, adverse effects due to acetyl fentanyl toxicity have been reported in humans. Similar to other opioids (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.</inline> heroin, oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, etc.), acetyl fentanyl induces respiratory depression which may lead to death in an overdose event. DEA is currently aware of at least 57 confirmed fatalities associated with acetyl fentanyl misuse and/or abuse in the United States. The extent of abuse and mortality associated with acetyl fentanyl is likely to be underestimated since it is not included in most drug screens. In addition, the identity of fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl cannot be distinguished by commonly used drug screens including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Further confirmatory testing (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.</inline> mass spectrometry) is required to identify acetyl fentanyl.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The DEA is not aware of any claims or any medical or scientific literature suggesting that acetyl fentanyl has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. In addition, HHS advised the DEA, by letter dated <date date="2015-04-29">April 29, 2015</date>, that there are no approved new drug applications or investigational new drug applications for acetyl fentanyl.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">By letter, dated <date date="2016-01-11">January 11, 2016</date>, the DEA requested that HHS conduct a scientific and medical evaluation of the substance's medical utility and a scheduling recommendation for acetyl fentanyl. Regardless of this request and any potential response from HHS, the DEA is not required under <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/d/1">21 U.S.C. 811(d)(1)</ref> to make any findings required by <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/a">21 U.S.C. 811(a)</ref> or 812(b), and is not required to follow the procedures prescribed by <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/a">21 U.S.C. 811(a)</ref> and (b). Therefore, consistent with the framework of <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s811/d">21 U.S.C. 811(d)</ref>, DEA concludes that acetyl fentanyl has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and is most appropriately placed (as it has been since July 2015) in schedule I of the CSA.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2017-03-10">March 10, 2017</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/82/13235">82 FR 13235</ref>), the EPA published a direct final rule (DFR) approving two SIP revisions submitted by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. On <date date="2012-04-03">April 3, 2012</date>, the State submitted to the EPA a CO maintenance plan as a SIP revision. This 2012 maintenance plan was intended to meet the CAA requirement (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">see</inline> CAA section 175A(b)) to submit a second maintenance plan. The CAA requires that, in the eighth year of an area's first 10-year maintenance plan, a second maintenance plan be submitted covering an additional ten years beyond the first 10-year period. Subsequently, on <date date="2016-08-26">August 26, 2016</date>, the State submitted a supplement to their 2012 submittal.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the <date date="2017-03-10">March 10, 2017</date> DFR, the EPA also approved a surrogate monitoring method for the State to monitor ambient levels of CO in the area. This surrogate monitoring method was described in both the 2012 submittal and 2016 supplement, with the 2016 supplement containing the State's final intended method.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the <date date="2017-03-10">March 10, 2017</date> DFR, the EPA stated that if adverse comments were received by <date date="2017-04-10">April 10, 2017</date>, the EPA would publish a timely withdrawal and address the comments in a subsequent final rule based on the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR), also published on <date date="2017-03-10">March 10, 2017</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/82/13269">82 FR 13269</ref>).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In this instance, the EPA received an adverse comment on the alternative monitoring strategy and attempted to withdraw the DFR prior to the effective date of <date date="2017-05-09">May 9, 2017</date>. However, the EPA inadvertently did not withdraw the DFR prior to that date and the rule prematurely became effective on <date date="2017-05-09">May 9, 2017</date>, revising the State's SIP to include the 2012 submittal and 2016 supplement on that date.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In today's final rule, the EPA is responding to the comment submitted on the EPA's proposed approval of revisions to the State's SIP, is approving the 2012 SIP submittal and 2016 supplement into the SIP, and is amending the effective date of the regulations' inclusion in the SIP to correct our failure to withdraw the DFR (after the EPA received an adverse public comment) prior to the <date date="2017-05-09">May 9, 2017</date> effective date of the DFR.

However, the commenter went on to comment adversely on the EPA's approval of the State's surrogate monitoring method, because monitoring methods are important to safeguard against a possible return of high levels of CO occurring in the region again, and the plan the EPA was approving did not offer any scenarios for reinstating monitoring.
</p>

                                          <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Response:</inline> The EPA acknowledges the commenter's support. However, we disagree with some of the assertions and conclusions in the comment. First, the text the commenter quoted from our action was taken from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The text the commenter quoted was that monitoring may be discontinued if the monitor in question has not measured violations of the applicable NAAQS in the previous five years. This text is not something that the EPA was proposing to approve in our action, but rather is text from the existing CFR (<ref href="/us/cfr/t40/p58">40 CFR part 58</ref>), that, in a general sense, describes the circumstances that the EPA evaluates in determining whether to allow discontinuation of a monitor. We are not acting on a general policy regarding the circumstances under which ambient monitoring may be discontinued, nor are we acting on a specific instance of a monitor's discontinuation. Rather, we said in the DFR that we are not taking action on the State's request to shut down the Harvey's monitor, and that the EPA would respond to the State's <?page num="26353"?>request in a separate action. We are instead approving a surrogate monitoring method for the State to use in the area.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, we believe the commenter is factually incorrect in stating that nothing is offered to reinstate ambient CO monitors “if CO were ever to plague the region again.” To the contrary, the EPA explained in the DFR the circumstances under which ambient monitoring would be re-started. The surrogate monitoring method is a method of monitoring that relies on indirect indicators (traffic counts) to be monitored during the entire second maintenance period, and that have in fact already commenced. The EPA has already received several years' worth of traffic count reports from the State. The surrogate monitoring method using traffic counts is an ongoing effort of the State, performed at two locations in the area. Further, if the traffic counts rise above trigger levels, the State will re-start ambient monitoring. Lastly, once ambient monitoring is triggered, specific stringent conditions must be met to discontinue ambient CO monitoring. This will be the case even if the EPA, in a separate future action, approves the State's 2012 request to discontinue ambient CO monitoring. That is, even if the EPA approves the shutdown of the Harvey's ambient CO monitor per the State's 2012 request, a triggered re-start of the monitor (“triggered monitoring”) would set in motion specific requirements before triggered monitoring could be discontinued. Regardless of the status of ambient CO monitoring, the State's traffic counts at two locations remain in place and are required by today's action to be continued throughout the maintenance period, through the end of 2024. The commenter did not provide any data or rationale for why monitoring methods should be addressed further.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The EPA is approving revisions to the Nevada SIP. The revisions incorporate the 2012 maintenance plan and 2016 supplement. The EPA is also amending the effective date of the inclusion of these revisions to the State's SIP because the revisions were added to the SIP prematurely on <date date="2017-05-09">May 9, 2017</date>, when the EPA did not withdraw its DFR after receiving a comment on our approval of the State's two SIP submittals. This rule responds to the comment received, finalizes our approval and corrects the effective date for inclusion of the State's two submittals into the SIP.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a request from the state of Tennessee for EPA to relax the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) standard applicable to gasoline introduced into commerce from June 1 to September 15 of each year in Davidson, Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson, and Wilson Counties (the Middle Tennessee Area). Specifically, EPA is approving amendments to the regulations to allow the gasoline RVP standard for the five counties to rise from 7.8 pounds per square inch (psi) to 9.0 psi. EPA has determined that this change to the federal RVP regulation is consistent with the applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Finally, EPA is making several minor technical corrections to address clerical errors made in prior rulemakings that relaxed the gasoline RVP standard in other areas.

Chapter 5</ref>, generally provides that rules may not take effect earlier than 30 days after they are published in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>. EPA is issuing this final rule under CAA section 307(d)(1) which states: “The provisions of section 553 through 557 . . . of Title 5 shall not, except as expressly provided in this subsection, apply to actions to which this subsection applies.” Thus, section 553(d) of the APA does not apply to this rule. EPA is nevertheless acting consistently with the policies underlying APA section 553(d) in making this rule effective <date date="2017-06-07">June 7, 2017</date>. APA section 553(d) allows an effective date less than 30 days after publication for a rule “that grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction.” <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/d/1">5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1)</ref>. This rule fits within that exception because it lifts a restriction on the introduction into commerce of gasoline with an RVP of greater than 7.8 psi sold in Davidson, Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson, and Wilson Counties between June 1 and September 15 of each year. Because this action can be considered to relieve a restriction that would otherwise prevent the introduction into commerce of gasoline with an RVP of greater than 7.8 psi, EPA is making this action effective on <date date="2017-06-07">June 7, 2017</date>.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This final rule approves a request from the state of Tennessee to change the summertime gasoline RVP standard for Davidson, Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson, and Wilson Counties from 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi by amending EPA's regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t40/s80.27/a/2">40 CFR 80.27(a)(2)</ref>. In a previous rulemaking, EPA approved a maintenance plan revision for the Middle Tennessee Area for the 1997 ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) and a CAA section 110(l) non-interference demonstration that relaxing the federal RVP gasoline requirement from 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi for gasoline sold from June 1 to September 15 of each year would not interfere with maintenance of the NAAQS in the Middle Tennessee Area.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">III. History of the Gasoline Volatility Requirement
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="1987-08-19">August 19, 1987</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/52/31274">52 FR 31274</ref>), EPA determined that gasoline nationwide was becoming increasingly volatile, causing an increase in evaporative emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles and equipment. Evaporative emissions from gasoline, referred to as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are precursors to the formation of tropospheric ozone and contribute to the nation's ground-level ozone problem. Exposure to ground-level ozone can reduce lung function, thereby aggravating asthma and other respiratory conditions, increase susceptibility to respiratory infection, and may contribute to premature death in people with heart and lung disease.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The most common measure of fuel volatility that is useful in evaluating gasoline evaporative emissions is RVP. Under CAA section 211(c), EPA promulgated regulations on <date date="1989-03-22">March 22, 1989</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/54/11868">54 FR 11868</ref>) that set maximum limits for the RVP of gasoline sold during the regulatory control periods that were established on a state-by-state basis in the final rule. The regulatory control periods addressed the portion of the year when peak ozone concentrations were expected. These regulations constituted Phase I of a two-phase nationwide program, which was designed to reduce the volatility of gasoline during the high ozone season. On <date date="1990-06-11">June 11, 1990</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/55/23658">55 FR 23658</ref>), EPA promulgated more stringent volatility controls as Phase II of the volatility control program. These requirements established maximum gasoline RVP standards of 9.0 psi or 7.8 psi (depending on the state, the month, and the area's initial ozone attainment designation with respect to the 1-hour ozone NAAQS).








 


</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The 1990 CAA Amendments established a new section 211(h) to address fuel volatility. CAA section 211(h) requires EPA to promulgate regulations making it unlawful to sell, offer for sale, dispense, supply, offer for supply, transport, or introduce into commerce gasoline with an RVP level in excess of 9.0 psi during the high ozone season. CAA section 211(h) also prohibits EPA from establishing a volatility standard more stringent than 9.0 psi in an attainment area, except that EPA may impose a lower (more stringent) standard in any former ozone nonattainment area redesignated to attainment.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="1991-12-12">December 12, 1991</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/56/64704">56 FR 64704</ref>), EPA modified the Phase II volatility regulations to be consistent with CAA section 211(h). The modified regulations <?page num="26356"?>prohibited the sale of gasoline with an RVP above 9.0 psi in all areas designated attainment for ozone, effective <date date="1992-01-13">January 13, 1992</date>. For areas designated as nonattainment, the regulations retained the original Phase II standards published on <date date="1990-06-11">June 11, 1990</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/55/23658">55 FR 23658</ref>), which included the 7.8 psi ozone season limitation for certain areas. As stated in the preamble to the Phase II volatility controls and reiterated in the proposed change to the volatility standards published in 1991, EPA will rely on states to initiate changes to their respective volatility programs. EPA's policy for approving such changes is described below in Section IV. of this action.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The state of Tennessee has initiated this change by requesting that EPA relax the 7.8 psi gasoline RVP standard to 9.0 psi for Davidson, Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson, and Wilson Counties, which are subject to the 7.8 gasoline RVP requirement during the summertime ozone season. Accordingly, the state of Tennessee provided a technical demonstration showing that relaxing the federal gasoline RVP requirements in the five counties from 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi would not interfere with maintenance of the NAAQS in the Middle Tennessee Area or with any other applicable CAA requirement. See Section V. of this action for information specific to Tennessee's request for the Middle Tennessee Area.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As stated in the rulemaking for EPA's amended Phase II volatility standards (<ref href="/us/fr/56/64706">56 FR 64706</ref>), any change in the volatility standard for a nonattainment area that was subsequently redesignated as an attainment area must be accomplished through a separate rulemaking that revises the applicable standard for that area. Thus, for former 1-hour ozone nonattainment areas where EPA mandated a Phase II volatility standard of 7.8 psi RVP in the <date date="1991-12-12">December 12, 1991</date> rulemaking, the federal 7.8 psi RVP gasoline requirement remains in effect, even after such an area is redesignated to attainment, until a separate rulemaking is completed that relaxes the federal RVP gasoline standard in that area from 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As explained in the <date date="1991-12-12">December 12, 1991</date> rulemaking, EPA believes that relaxation of an applicable gasoline RVP standard is best accomplished in conjunction with the redesignation process. In order for an ozone nonattainment area to be redesignated as an attainment area, CAA section 107(d)(3) requires the state to make a showing, pursuant to CAA section 175A(a), that the area is capable of maintaining attainment for the ozone NAAQS for ten years. Depending on the area's circumstances, this maintenance plan will either demonstrate that the area is capable of maintaining attainment for ten years without the more stringent gasoline volatility standard or that the more stringent gasoline volatility standard may be necessary for the area to maintain attainment of the ozone NAAQS. Therefore, in the context of a request for redesignation, EPA will not relax the gasoline volatility standard unless the state requests a relaxation and the maintenance plan demonstrates to the satisfaction of EPA that the area will maintain attainment for ten years without the need for the more stringent volatility standard.

The revised maintenance plan adjusts the on-road emissions inventory and maintenance demonstration so that they account for removal of the federal requirement to sell 7.8 psi gasoline and instead sell gasoline with an RVP of 9.0 psi during the summer ozone season. As part of its request, TDEC also submitted a CAA section 110(l) non-interference demonstration that removal of the federal RVP requirement of 7.8 psi for gasoline during the summertime ozone season for the Middle Tennessee Area would not interfere with maintenance of any NAAQS, including the 1997 and 2015 ozone NAAQS. Specifically, the State provided a technical demonstration showing that relaxing the federal gasoline RVP requirement in the five counties, from 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi, would not interfere with maintenance of the ozone NAAQS or with any other applicable requirement of the CAA.

The proposal provided an opportunity for the public to comment on the action. (<ref href="/us/fr/82/11517">82 FR 11517</ref>). EPA received no comments on the proposal to approve the revised maintenance plan request and the non-interference demonstration for the Middle Tennessee Area.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">With regard to the possibility that the summertime gasoline RVP increase could jeopardize the area's ability to remain in attainment with the 2015 ozone NAAQS of 70 ppb, as previously explained, this comment is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. Further, as also previously explained, the proposal for the <date date="2017-05-01">May 1, 2017</date> rulemaking contained an evaluation of the air quality impacts associated with the change in RVP requirements and determined that any such impacts will not interfere with attainment or maintenance of any NAAQS or with any other applicable requirement of the CAA as required by CAA section 110(l). Thus, EPA, in a prior rulemaking, which included extensive information and data from the State, such as the projection of the design values and the effect of slight increases in emissions associated with the RVP relaxation, has concluded that the Area would continue to attain any ozone NAAQS, including the 2015 ozone NAAQS, after the RVP relaxation. (<ref href="/us/fr/82/20260">82 FR 20260</ref>, <date date="2017-05-01">May 1, 2017</date>). In the <date date="2017-02-24">February 24, 2017</date> proposal, EPA had also provided adequate opportunity for public comments on the CAA section 110(l) non-interference demonstration as well as the extensive information that supported the demonstration. No adverse comments were received on that proposal. The proposed notice for today's action did not re-open the previous rulemaking.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Similarly, EPA believes that the comment on Tennessee's calculations of the emissions change due to the RVP relaxation is also beyond the scope of this rulemaking. As previously explained, EPA provided adequate opportunity for public comment on the previous rulemaking that approved the State's maintenance plan revision and CAA section 110(l) non-interference demonstration. (<ref href="/us/fr/82/20260">82 FR 20260</ref>, <date date="2017-05-01">May 1, 2017</date>). No adverse comments were received on the proposal for the <date date="2017-05-01">May 1, 2017</date> rulemaking. Notwithstanding that this comment is outside of the scope of this rulemaking, Tennessee did properly quantify the emissions change attributed to the increase of the summertime RVP standard of 7.8 psi (effectively 8.8 psi with the 1.0 psi ethanol waiver) to 9.0 psi (effectively 10.0 psi with the 1.0 psi ethanol waiver). (<ref href="/us/fr/82/11517">82 FR 11517</ref>, 11520–11523, <date date="2017-02-24">February 24, 2017</date>). As noted above, the proposed notice for today's action did not re-open the previous rulemaking. Based on the evidence in the record, EPA is granting the State's request to relax the summertime RVP standard from 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi.

The small entities subject to the requirements of this action are refiners, importers or blenders of gasoline that choose to produce or import low RVP gasoline for sale in Tennessee and gasoline distributers and retail stations in Tennessee. This action relaxes the federal RVP standard for gasoline sold in Davidson, Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson, and Wilson Counties during the summertime ozone season (June 1 to September 15 of each year) to allow the RVP for gasoline sold to rise from 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi. This rule does not impose any requirements or create impacts on small entities beyond those, if any, already required by or resulting from the CAA section 211(h) Volatility Control program.

Therefore, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations are not an anticipated result.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NHTSA bases this action in part on the Presidential directive expressed in the memorandum of <date date="2017-01-20">January 20, 2017</date>, from the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, entitled “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review” (the <date date="2017-01-20">January 20, 2017</date> memorandum). That memorandum directed the heads of Executive Departments and Agencies to temporarily postpone for 60 days from the date of the memorandum the effective dates of certain regulations that had been published in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>, but had not yet taken effect. Because the original effective date of the final rule published on <date date="2016-12-14">December 14, 2016</date>, fell within that 60-day window, the effective date of the rule was extended to <date date="2017-03-21">March 21, 2017</date>, in a final rule published on <date date="2017-02-06">February 6, 2017</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/82/9368">82 FR 9368</ref>). The effective date was again extended to <date date="2017-05-22">May 22, 2017</date>, in a final rule published <date date="2017-03-21">March 21, 2017</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/82/14477">82 FR 14477</ref>). The effective date was further extended until <date date="2017-06-05">June 5, 2017</date>, in a final rule published <date date="2017-05-22">May 22, 2017</date> (<ref href="/us/fr/82/23150">82 FR 23150</ref>). Consistent with the memorandum of the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, and as stated in the <date date="2017-02-06">February 6, 2017</date>, final rule delaying the effective date, the Agency further delays the effective date of this regulation until <date date="2017-09-05">September 5, 2017</date>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This delay of the effective date of the final rule is also based on the need to allow additional time to respond to several petitions for reconsideration filed in response to the final rule. These responses will provide regulated entities with greater certainty as to the requirements of the Minimum Sound Requirements for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles final rule prior to the rule coming into effect. Delaying the effective date of the final rule to allow additional time to respond to these petitions for reconsideration is prudent in this instance because the petitions concern topics such as the date by which manufacturers are required to comply with the rule's requirements and the stringency of the requirements themselves, both of which impact manufacturers' compliance plans.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Agency's implementation of this action without opportunity for public comment is based on the good cause exceptions in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)</ref> and 553(d)(3), in that seeking public comment is impracticable, unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. The delay in the effective date until <date date="2017-09-05">September 5, 2017</date>, is necessary to provide the opportunity for further review and consideration of this new regulation, consistent with the <date date="2017-01-20">January 20, 2017</date> memorandum. Given the imminence of the effective date of the “Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Minimum Sound Requirements for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles” final rule, seeking prior public comment on this temporary delay would be impractical, as well as contrary to the public interest in the orderly promulgation and implementation of regulations.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">These regulations, issued under the authority of the MMPA (<ref href="/us/usc/t16/s1361">16 U.S.C. 1361</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.</inline>), establish a framework for authorizing the take of marine mammals incidental to the Navy's waterfront construction activities at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, GA (NSB Kings Bay). The Navy plans to repair (including direct repairs and repairs by component replacement) in-water structures at NSB Kings Bay, construct a new Transit Protection System Operational Support Facility, and extend the existing Layberth Pier in order to (1) address critical damage and mission and safety requirements, (2) limit further deterioration and increase the useful life of the structures, and (3) upgrade infrastructure to meet requirements of new submarine technology. Construction will include use of impact and vibratory pile driving, including installation and removal of steel, concrete, composite, and timber piles.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We received an application from the Navy requesting five-year regulations and authorization to take bottlenose dolphins. Take is anticipated to occur by Level B harassment incidental to impact and vibratory pile installation and removal. The regulations are valid from 2017 to 2022. Please see the “Background” section below for definitions of harassment.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 101(a)(5)(A) of the MMPA (<ref href="/us/usc/t16/s1371/a/5/A">16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(5)(A)</ref>) directs the Secretary of Commerce to allow, upon request, the incidental, but not intentional taking of small numbers of marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographical region for up to five years if, after notice and public comment, the agency makes certain findings and issues regulations that set forth permissible methods of taking pursuant to that activity, as well as monitoring and reporting requirements. Section 101(a)(5)(A) of the MMPA and the implementing regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/p216">50 CFR part 216</ref>, subpart I provide the legal basis for issuing this final rule containing five-year regulations, and for any subsequent LOAs. As directed by this legal authority, this final rule contains mitigation, monitoring, and reporting requirements.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">An authorization for incidental takings shall be granted if NMFS finds that the taking will have a negligible impact on the species or stock(s), will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock(s) for subsistence uses (where relevant), and if the permissible methods of taking and requirements pertaining to the mitigation, monitoring and reporting of such takings are set forth. NMFS has defined “negligible impact” in <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s216.103">50 CFR 216.103</ref> as an impact resulting from the specified activity that cannot be reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Except with respect to certain activities not pertinent here, the MMPA defines “harassment” as: Any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which (i) has the potential to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild (Level A harassment); or (ii) has the potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering (Level B harassment).

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Navy plans to repair in-water structures at NSB Kings Bay, as well as to construct new facilities and modify existing facilities. These repairs, upgrades, and new construction would include use of impact and vibratory pile driving, including installation and removal of steel, concrete, composite, and timber piles. Hereafter (unless otherwise specified or detailed), we use the term “pile driving” to refer to both pile installation and pile removal. The use of both vibratory and impact pile driving is expected to produce underwater sound at levels that have the potential to result in behavioral harassment of marine mammals. Only the bottlenose dolphin (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Tursiops truncatus truncatus</inline>) is expected to be present.

</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Overview
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NSB Kings Bay is the Navy's east coast home port for ballistic missile nuclear submarines supporting the Trident II (D–5) missile. NSB Kings Bay manages, maintains, and operates Trident ballistic missile (SSBN) and guided missile (SSGN) submarines, Trident II D–5 and Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles and systems, and infrastructure and quality of life facilities and programs. In 2010, the Navy found that conditions of water-<?page num="26362"?>based support facilities varied widely from good to seriously deteriorated. Continuous monitoring of these conditions by Navy at NSB Kings Bay has confirmed the advanced deterioration and critical nature of some issues that pose operational and safety risks. Additionally, other areas of initial deterioration were identified which require remedy in order to maintain the useful life of existing structures. Damage observed includes deteriorated concrete piles, pile caps, and deck components (cracked, spalled, delaminated, exposed/corroded internal reinforcing steel structures); marine pest (marine wood borer) damage on wooden piles; broken or unmaintained mooring fittings; and corrosion on steel piles and pile caps. In some cases, it is more cost effective to demolish older structures that are deteriorated and not well configured to fit existing and upcoming assets and replace them with new structures that are specifically designed to meet new mission requirements.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">To ensure the Navy can continue its mission of supporting the Fleet Ballistic Missile System and Trident Submarine Program, the Navy plans to repair (including direct repairs and repairs by component replacement) in-water structures at NSB Kings Bay, construct a new Transit Protection System Operational Support Facility, and extend the existing Layberth Pier. These repairs, upgrades, and new construction will (1) address critical damage and mission and safety requirements, (2) limit further deterioration and increase the useful life of the structures, and (3) upgrade infrastructure to meet requirements of new submarine technology. Construction will include use of impact and vibratory pile driving, including installation and removal of steel, concrete, composite, and timber piles. The specified activity is comprised of six distinct projects, four of which are comprised of multiple smaller projects.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Dates and Duration
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The specified activity may occur at any time during the five-year period of validity of the regulations. Planned dates of individual projects and project components are shown in Table 1, however, project dates may shift. In-water construction activities would occur during daylight hours, defined here as one hour post-sunrise to one hour prior to sunset.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Specified Geographical Region
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NSB Kings Bay is located in southeastern Georgia, approximately four miles inland (straight line distance) from the Atlantic Ocean, and approximately eight miles north of the Georgia-Florida border, along the western shore of Cumberland Sound (see Figure 2–1 in the Navy's application). NSB Kings Bay is an approximately 16,000-acre installation including the land areas and adjacent water areas along Kings Bay and Cumberland Sound between Marianna Creek to the north and Mill Creek to the south, and is restricted from general public access.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This estuarine environment receives salt water input from ocean waters through tidal exchange, and fresh water input from rivers, tributaries, and stormwater outfalls. The large tidal range and strong currents result in tidally mixed waters that are refreshed on a daily basis. Please see section 2 of the Navy's application for more information.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Detailed Description of Activities
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Navy plans to remove deteriorated timber, concrete, and steel piles and replace them with concrete, composite, and steel piles. New construction would involve installation of steel, concrete, and composite piles. Aspects of construction activities other than pile driving are not anticipated to have the potential to result in incidental take of marine mammals because they are either above water or do not produce levels of underwater sound with likely potential to result in marine mammal disturbance. Therefore, we do not discuss elements of construction activity other than pile driving. No concurrent pile driving would occur. Project specific pile totals are given in Table 1.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A vibratory hammer will be used for all pile removal work. If use of the vibratory hammer is not feasible for pile installation (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> with steel piles), a Delmag Pile Hammer D62–22 or equivalent impact hammer will be used. The Delmag Pile Hammer D62–22 is a single acting diesel impact hammer with energy capacity of 76,899–153,799 foot-pounds. The most effective and efficient method of pile installation available will be implemented for each project. The method fitting these criteria may vary based on specific project requirements and local conditions. In some areas of Kings Bay a limestone layer can be found relatively close to the substrate/water interface. This type of layer requires impact driving because vibratory installation will not drive the piles to a sufficient depth. Impact driving, while generally producing higher levels of sound, also minimizes the net amount of active driving time, thus reducing the amount of time during which marine mammals may be exposed to noise. Impact or vibratory pile driving could occur on any day, but would not occur simultaneously.

Therefore, for example, although the description of Project 1A includes a maximum of 31 days of vibratory removal and 30 days of impact installation, these days would not likely be independent, and the much smaller disturbance zone for impact driving would be contained within the zone associated with vibratory driving. We have revised the monitoring plan to include monitoring of the disturbance on a portion of days associated with Project 2; with this addition, all projects other than 1B and the FY17 phase of Project 3A (each of which involves only two days of pile driving) incorporate some disturbance zone monitoring effort. We therefore believe that the monitoring plan achieves the goals expressed in the Commission's recommendation.

In summary, the southern Georgia estuarine system stock and the South Carolina/Georgia coastal stock are expected to be the two stocks most likely to be affected by the specified activity. Individual animals from the northern Florida and southern migratory (January to March only) coastal stocks and the Jacksonville estuarine system stock may also occur rarely.

Therefore, we do not reprint the information here but refer the reader to that document. That discussion included a summary and discussion of the ways that components of the specified activity may impact marine mammals and their habitat. The “Estimated Take” section later in this preamble includes a quantitative analysis of the number of incidents of <?page num="26365"?>take expected to occur incidental to this activity. The “Negligible Impact Analysis” section includes an analysis of how this specific activity will impact marine mammals, and considers the content of the discussion of potential effects to marine mammals and their habitat, the “Estimated Take” section, and the “Mitigation” section, to draw conclusions regarding the likely impacts of these activities on the reproductive success or survivorship of individuals, and from that on the affected marine mammal populations or stocks.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Anticipated takes would be by Level B harassment, as pile driving activity has the potential to result in disruption of behavioral patterns for individual marine mammals. Level A harassment by auditory injury is unlikely to occur as a result of this activity for bottlenose dolphins (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> mid-frequency hearing specialists) and, although it is unlikely that take by Level A harassment would occur even in the absence of the planned mitigation and monitoring measures, the measures are expected to further minimize such potential. The Navy has requested authorization for the incidental taking by Level B harassment of bottlenose dolphins in the vicinity of NSB Kings Bay that may result from pile driving during waterfront construction activities described previously in this document.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Based on consideration of NMFS's 2016 “Technical Guidance for Assessing the Effects of Anthropogenic Sound on Marine Mammal Hearing,” potential injury zones are fully encompassed by Navy's planned shutdown zones. Predicted isopleth distances for auditory injury (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> Level A harassment) were calculated for all construction scenarios (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> combinations of pile types, hammer types, and assumed number of piles driven per day or driving duration per day). This information was used with NMFS's optional user spreadsheet, a tool developed to help applicants implement the new Technical Guidance. For vibratory driving, predicted zones ranged from less than 1 m to 3.6 meters (m). For impact driving, predicted zone ranged from less than 1 m to 38 m. All zones were smaller than the Navy's proposed minimum shutdown zone of 15 m, except for impact driving of 24-in steel piles associated with project 4B in FY20 (16.6 m) and impact driving of 30-in steel piles associated with project 3F in FY 2021 (38 m). Shutdown zones associated with these projects would be increased to 20 m and 40 m, respectively, in order to encompass the predicted injury zones. In consideration of the small injury zones and the Navy's mitigation, we believe that injury will be avoided. We have considered the new guidance and believe that the likelihood of injury is adequately addressed in this analysis, and appropriate protective measures are in place in these regulations.

Transmission loss (TL) is the decrease in acoustic intensity as an acoustic pressure wave propagates out from a source. TL parameters vary with frequency, temperature, sea conditions, current, source and receiver depth, water depth, water chemistry, and bottom composition and topography. The general formula for underwater TL is:</p>

The degree to which underwater sound propagates away from a sound source is dependent on a variety of factors, most notably the water bathymetry and presence or absence of reflective or absorptive conditions including in-water structures and sediments. Spherical spreading occurs in a perfectly unobstructed (free-field) environment not limited by depth or water surface, resulting in a 6 dB reduction in sound level for each doubling of distance from the source (20*log(range)). Cylindrical spreading occurs in an environment in which sound propagation is bounded by the water surface and sea bottom, resulting in a reduction of 3 decibels (dB) in sound level for each doubling of distance from the source (10*log(range)). As is common practice in coastal waters, here we assume practical spreading loss (4.5 dB reduction in sound level for each doubling of distance) here. Practical spreading is a compromise that is often used under conditions where water increases with depth as the receiver moves away from the shoreline, resulting in an expected propagation environment that would lie between spherical and cylindrical spreading loss conditions.

However, there are no measurements available from the specific environment of NSB Kings Bay. Numerous studies have examined sound <?page num="26366"?>pressure levels (SPLs) recorded from underwater pile driving projects in California and Washington, and the Navy has conducted a few studies on the east coast. In addition, the majority of studies are focused on steel pipe piles, with less data available for other pile types. In order to determine reasonable SPLs and their associated effects on marine mammals that are likely to result from pile driving at NSB Kings Bay, studies with similar properties to the specified activity were evaluated, and are displayed in Table 5. Where available, data from the east coast were prioritized due to the differences in bathymetry and sediment at west coast sites. For pile types for which data from the east coast were not available, averages of west coast data were used to approximate source levels. For fiberglass reinforced plastic composite piles, no measured data are available. The source level estimates for this type of pile were based on data from timber piles driven on the east coast of the U.S, assuming that this is the most similar pile material. In all cases, where data from the same pile size/type were not available, a more conservative proxy was used. Where appropriate, weighted project averages were considered. Values measured at distances greater than 10 m were normalized to 10 m before calculating averages. For full details of data considered, please see Appendix C of the Navy's application.

All calculated distances to and the total area encompassed by the marine mammal sound thresholds are provided in Table 6. Calculated radial distances to the 160 dB threshold assume a field free of obstruction. However, the waters surrounding NSB Kings Bay do not represent open water conditions and the calculated zone-specific areas take landforms into consideration. Actual zones are depicted in Figures 6–1 through 6–26 of the Navy's application. Although calculated radial distances to threshold do not change, the actual zone sizes may vary depending on the specific project location.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Navy conducted marine mammal surveys at NSB Kings Bay during 2006–2007 (McKee and Latusek, 2009). Transect lines were run in the waters around NSB Kings Bay during summer and fall 2006 and during winter and spring 2007. The survey area included estuarine waters extending from the mouth of the St. Marys River north through the Cumberland Sound to approximately eight nautical miles (nmi) inland along the Satilla River. The Crooked River and the Brickhill River, which flow into Cumberland Sound, were also part of the study area, though line transects were not possible in these locations, and census counts were substituted here. The geographic limits ranged from 30°40′ N. to 31°00′ N. and inland limits to 81°40′ W. Nearshore Atlantic waters were not included in the surveys.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Observations were made with 7x50 power binoculars and with the naked eye, scanning from 0–90° relative to the vessel's line of travel. Sightings, radial distance and angle to animal, and number of individuals were recorded. For census count areas, the vessel was driven along the center line of the river and distance and angle to sightings were noted. Commercially available software (Distance 5.0) was used to analyze the collected data, including area surveyed, and calculate a seasonal density. Seasonal densities were combined to calculate an average annual density of 1.12 dolphins per square kilometer (km<sup style="-uslm-sgm:SU">2</sup>).

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The species density described above (1.12 animals/km<sup style="-uslm-sgm:SU">2</sup>) was multiplied by the activity-specific ZOIs shown in Table 6 to determine the estimated daily exposures. The Navy then rounded these daily exposure estimates to the nearest whole number before multiplying by activity-specific pile driving days, shown in Table 1, to yield the exposure estimates shown in Table 7. The Navy has requested authorization for a total of 881 incidents of Level B harassment of bottlenose dolphins over the five-year period of validity of these regulations. Table 7 displays the total take estimate broken out by project and year. However, note that year assignments reflect only the projected project start years. Projects may continue into succeeding years, but neither exact start dates nor whether a project would in fact continue into the succeeding year are known at this time.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">NMFS has defined “negligible impact” in <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s216.103">50 CFR 216.103</ref> as an impact resulting from the specified activity that cannot be reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival. A negligible impact finding is based on the lack of likely adverse effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> population-level effects). An estimate of the number of takes alone is not enough information on which to base an impact determination. In addition to considering estimates of the number of marine mammals that might be taken by mortality, serious injury, and Level A or Level B harassment, we consider other factors, such as the likely nature of any behavioral responses (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> intensity, duration), the context of any such responses (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> critical reproductive time or location, migration), as well as the number and nature of estimated Level A harassment takes (if any), and effects on habitat. We also assess the number, intensity, and context of estimated takes by evaluating this information relative to population status (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> the environmental baseline).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Consistent with the 1989 preamble for NMFS's implementing regulations (<ref href="/us/fr/54/40338">54 FR 40338</ref>; <date date="1989-09-29">September 29, 1989</date>), the impacts from other past and ongoing anthropogenic activities are incorporated into these analyses via their impacts on the environmental baseline (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> as reflected in the regulatory status of the species, population size and growth rate where known, sources of human-caused mortality).








 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Pile driving activities associated with the wharf construction projects, as described previously, have the potential to disturb or displace marine mammals. Specifically, the specified activities may result in take, in the form of Level B harassment (behavioral disturbance) only, from underwater sounds generated from pile driving. Potential takes could occur if individual bottlenose dolphins are present in the ensonified zone when pile driving is happening.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">No serious injury or mortality would be expected even in the absence of the planned mitigation measures. No Level A harassment is anticipated given the nature of the activities and measures designed to minimize the possibility of injury. The potential for injury is small, and is expected to be essentially eliminated through implementation of the planned mitigation measures—soft start (for impact driving) and shutdown zones. Impact driving, as compared with vibratory driving, has source characteristics (short, sharp pulses with higher peak levels and much sharper rise time to reach those peaks) that are potentially injurious or more likely to produce severe behavioral reactions. Given sufficient notice through use of soft start, marine mammals are expected to move away from a sound source that is annoying prior to its becoming potentially injurious or resulting in more severe behavioral reactions. Environmental conditions in waters surrounding NSB Kings Bay are expected to generally be good, with calm sea states, albeit with high turbidity. Nevertheless, we expect conditions would allow a high marine mammal detection capability, enabling a high rate of success in implementation of shutdowns to avoid injury.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Effects on individuals that are taken by Level B harassment, on the basis of reports in the literature as well as monitoring from other similar activities, will likely be limited to reactions such as increased swimming speeds, increased surfacing time, or decreased foraging (if such activity were occurring) (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.,</inline> Thorson and Reyff, 2006; HDR, Inc., 2012; Lerma, 2014). Most likely, individuals will simply move away from the sound source and be temporarily displaced from the areas of pile driving, although even this reaction has been observed primarily only in association with impact pile driving. The pile driving activities analyzed here are similar to, or less impactful than, numerous other construction activities conducted in San Francisco Bay and in the Puget Sound region, which have taken place with no known long-term adverse consequences from behavioral harassment.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Navy has conducted similar multi-year activities potentially affecting bottlenose dolphins in San Diego Bay and in the same general region at Mayport, Florida, that have similarly reported no apparently consequential behavioral reactions or long-term effects on bottlenose dolphin populations (Lerma, 2014; Navy, 2015). Repeated exposures of individuals to relatively low levels of sound outside of preferred habitat areas are unlikely to significantly disrupt critical behaviors. Thus, even repeated Level B harassment of some small subset of the overall stock is unlikely to result in any significant realized decrease in viability for the affected individuals, and thus would not result in any adverse impact to the stock as a whole. Level B harassment will be reduced to the level of least practicable adverse impact through use of mitigation measures described herein and, if sound produced by project activities is sufficiently disturbing, animals are likely to simply avoid the area while the activity is occurring. While vibratory driving associated with some project components may produce sound at distances of multiple kilometers from the pile driving site, thus intruding on higher-quality habitat, the project sites themselves and the majority of sound fields produced by the specified activities are within a heavily impacted, industrialized area. Therefore, we expect that animals annoyed by project sound would simply avoid the area and use more-preferred habitats.








 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In summary, this negligible impact analysis is founded on the following factors: (1) The possibility of injury, serious injury, or mortality may reasonably be considered discountable; (2) the anticipated incidents of Level B harassment consist of, at worst, temporary modifications in behavior; (3) the absence of any significant habitat within the project area, including known areas or features of special significance for foraging or reproduction; and (4) the presumed efficacy of the planned mitigation measures in reducing the effects of the specified activity to the level of least practicable adverse impact. In addition, while some of the potentially affected stocks are considered depleted under the MMPA, it is unlikely that minor noise effects in a small, localized area would have any effect on the stocks' ability to recover. In combination, we believe that these factors, as well as the available body of evidence from other similar activities, demonstrate that the potential effects of the specified activities will have only minor, short-term effects on individuals. The specified activities are not expected to impact rates of recruitment or survival and will therefore not result in population-level impacts.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Based on the analysis contained herein of the likely effects of the specified activity on marine mammals and their habitat, and taking into consideration the implementation of the planned monitoring and mitigation measures, we find that the total marine mammal take from the Navy's waterfront construction activities will have a negligible impact on the affected marine mammal species or stocks.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Small Numbers Analysis
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Please see Table 7 for information relating to this small numbers analysis; as described previously, although we provide exposure estimates broken out by year and project component, we do not have specific information about when each project would be concluded <?page num="26369"?>or therefore how many takes may actually accrue in any given year during the five-year period of validity of these regulations. An average of 176 incidents of behavioral harassment of bottlenose dolphins is predicted to occur annually over the five-year effective period of these regulations; we have no information allowing us to parse the predicted incidents amongst the stocks of bottlenose dolphin that may occur in the project area. However, because they would be expected to occur only rarely and/or seasonally, we assume that only small numbers of individuals of the northern Florida coastal, southern migratory coastal, and Jacksonville estuarine system stocks would be potentially present and available to be taken as a result of the specified activities.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The South Carolina/Georgia coastal and southern Georgia estuarine system (SGES) stocks are expected to potentially be present more regularly. For the South Carolina/Georgia coastal stock, the predicted annual average number of incidents of take to be authorized is considered small—approximately four percent—even if each estimated taking was of a new individual. This is an extremely unlikely scenario as, for bottlenose dolphins in estuarine and nearshore waters, there is likely to be some overlap in individuals present day-to-day.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The total number of authorized takes for bottlenose dolphins, if assumed to accrue solely to unique individuals of the SGES stock, is higher relative to the total stock abundance, which is currently estimated at 194 individuals. As described previously, this estimate is the result of surveys covering only a portion of the stock range and is assumed to underestimate the stock abundance. Regardless, these numbers represent the estimated incidents of take, not the number of individuals taken. That is, it is highly likely that a relatively small subset of SGES bottlenose dolphins would be harassed by project activities. SGES bottlenose dolphins range from Cumberland Sound at the Georgia-Florida border north to the Altamaha Sound, Georgia, an area spanning approximately 70 linear km of coastline and including habitat consisting of complex inshore and estuarine waterways. SGES dolphins show strong site fidelity (Balmer <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.,</inline> 2013), and it is likely that the majority of SGES dolphins would not occur within waters ensonified by project activities. In summary, SGES dolphins are known to exhibit strong site fidelity (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> individuals do not generally range throughout the recognized overall SGES stock range), and the specified activity will be stationary within a relatively enclosed industrial area not recognized as an area of any special significance that would serve to attract or aggregate dolphins. We therefore believe that the estimated numbers of take, were they to occur, likely represent repeated exposures of a much smaller number of bottlenose dolphins, and that these estimated incidents of take represent small numbers of bottlenose dolphins.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Based on the analysis contained herein of the likely effects of the specified activity on marine mammals and their habitat, we find that small numbers of marine mammals will be taken relative to the populations of the affected species or stocks.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In order to issue an incidental take authorization under section 101(a)(5)(A) of the MMPA, NMFS must set forth the permissible methods of taking pursuant to such activity, “and other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on such species or stock and its habitat, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance, and on the availability of such species or stock for subsistence uses.” NMFS's implementing regulations require applicants for incidental take authorizations to include information about the availability and feasibility (economic and technological) of equipment, methods, and manner of conducting such activity or other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact upon the affected species or stocks and their habitat (<ref href="/us/cfr/t50/s216.104/a/11">50 CFR 216.104(a)(11)</ref>).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The mitigation strategies described below largely follow those required and successfully implemented under previous incidental take authorizations issued in association with similar construction activities. Measurements from similar pile driving events were coupled with practical spreading loss and other relevant information to estimate zones of influence (ZOI; see “Estimated Take” section); these ZOI values were used to develop mitigation measures for pile driving activities at NSB Kings Bay. Background discussion related to underwater sound concepts and terminology was provided in the section on “Description of Sound Sources,” in our <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> notice of proposed rulemaking (January 3, 2017; <ref href="/us/fr/82/684">82 FR 684</ref>, at 694–695). Practical spreading loss is discussed in further detail previously in this preamble in the section on “Zones of Influence.” The ZOIs effectively represent the mitigation zone that would be established around each pile to prevent Level A harassment to dolphins, while providing estimates of the areas within which Level B harassment might occur. In addition to the specific measures described later in this section, the Navy will conduct briefings for construction supervisors and crews, marine mammal monitoring team, and Navy staff prior to the start of all pile driving activity, and when new personnel join the work, in order to explain responsibilities, communication procedures, marine mammal monitoring protocol, and operational procedures. All relevant personnel will watch applicable sections of the Navy's Marine Species Awareness Training video. Relevant personnel will also follow NMFS's “Southeast Region Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Viewing Guidelines,” which are described in Attachment 1 of Navy's Monitoring Plan.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The following measures will apply to the Navy's mitigation through shutdown and disturbance zones:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">
                                          <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Shutdown Zone</inline>—The purpose of a shutdown zone is to define an area within which shutdown of activity would occur upon sighting of a marine mammal (or in anticipation of an animal entering the defined area), thus preventing some undesirable outcome, such as auditory injury or behavioral disturbance of sensitive species (serious injury or death are unlikely outcomes even in the absence of mitigation measures). For all pile driving activities, the Navy will establish a minimum shutdown zone with radial distance of 15 m. This minimum zone is intended to prevent the already unlikely possibility of physical interaction with construction equipment and to establish a precautionary minimum zone with regard to acoustic effects.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As described previously in the “Estimated Take” section, we used NMFS's user spreadsheet, an optional companion spreadsheet associated with the alternative implementation methodology provided in Appendix D of NMFS's acoustic guidance (NMFS, 2016), to calculate project, pile type, and pile driving methodology-specific zones within which auditory injury (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> Level A harassment) could occur. The user spreadsheet is publicly available online at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/acoustics/guidelines.htm.</inline> In using the spreadsheet, we assumed practical spreading loss and used supplementary information provided by the Navy regarding assumed number of piles driven per day and number of pile strikes necessary to install a pile (for <?page num="26370"?>impact pile driving) and daily duration of pile driving (for vibratory pile driving). Assumed source levels are provided in Table 5.








 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In most cases, this minimum shutdown zone of 15 m is expected to contain the area in which auditory injury could occur. All predicted auditory injury zones are less than the minimum 15 m shutdown zone (radial distance range: 0.5–13.1 m), with the exception of impact driving of 30-in steel piles associated with Project 3F (radial distance of 38 m) and impact driving of 24-in steel piles associated with Project 4B (radial distance of 16.6 m). In all cases, predicted injury zones are calculated on the basis of cumulative sound exposure, as peak pressure source levels are below the injury threshold for mid-frequency cetaceans. For these two scenarios we require shutdown zones of 40 m and 20 m radial distance, respectively.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Injury zone predictions generated using the optional user spreadsheet are precautionary due to a number of simplifying assumptions. For example, the spreadsheet tool assumes that marine mammals remain stationary during the activity and does not account for potential recovery between intermittent sounds. In addition, the tool incorporates the acoustic guidance's weighting functions through use of a single-frequency weighting factor adjustment intended to represent the signal's 95 percent frequency contour percentile (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> upper frequency below which 95 percent of total cumulative energy is contained; Charif <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et al.,</inline> 2010). This will typically result in higher predicted exposures for broadband sounds, since only one frequency is being considered, compared to exposures associated with the ability to fully incorporate the guidance's weighting functions.

Disturbance zones provide utility for monitoring conducted for mitigation purposes (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> shutdown zone monitoring) by establishing monitoring protocols for areas adjacent to the shutdown zones. Monitoring of disturbance zones enables observers to be aware of and communicate the presence of marine mammals in the project area but outside the shutdown zone, and thus prepare for potential shutdowns of activity. However, the primary purpose of disturbance zone monitoring is for documenting incidents of Level B harassment; disturbance zone monitoring is discussed in greater detail later (see “Monitoring and Reporting”). Nominal radial distances for disturbance zones are shown in Table 6.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In order to document observed incidents of harassment, monitors record all marine mammal observations, regardless of location. The observer's location and the location of the pile being driven are known, and the location of the animal may be estimated as a distance from the observer and then compared to the location from the pile. It may then be estimated whether the animal was exposed to sound levels constituting incidental harassment on the basis of predicted distances to relevant thresholds in post-processing of observational data, and a precise accounting of observed incidents of harassment created. This information may then be used to extrapolate observed takes to reach an approximate understanding of actual total takes, in cases where the entire zone was not monitored and/or all days of activity were not monitored.

In addition, observers will record all incidents of marine mammal occurrence, regardless of distance from activity, and monitors will document any behavioral reactions in concert with distance from piles being driven. Observations made outside the shutdown zone will not result in shutdown. That pile segment will be completed without cessation, unless the animal approaches or enters the shutdown zone, at which point all pile driving activities would be halted. Monitoring will take place from 15 minutes prior to initiation through 30 minutes post-completion of pile driving activities. Pile driving activities include the time to install or remove a single pile or series of piles, as long as the time elapsed between uses of the pile driving equipment is no more than thirty minutes. Observation of shutdown zones will always occur, but observation of the larger disturbance zones will occur on a subset of days associated with each specific project (see project-specific details provided in “Monitoring and Reporting,” later in this document). Please see the Monitoring Plan, developed by the Navy in agreement with NMFS, for full details of the monitoring protocols.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The use of a soft start procedure is believed to provide additional protection to marine mammals by warning marine mammals or providing them with a chance to leave the area prior to the hammer operating at full capacity, and typically involves a requirement to initiate sound from the hammer at reduced energy followed by a waiting period. This procedure is repeated two additional times. It is difficult to specify the reduction in energy for any given hammer because of variation across drivers and, for impact hammers, the actual number of strikes at reduced energy will vary because operating the hammer at less than full power results in “bouncing” of the hammer as it strikes the pile, resulting in multiple “strikes.” The Navy will utilize soft start techniques for impact pile driving. We require an initial set of three strikes from the impact hammer at reduced energy, followed by a 30-second waiting period, then 2 subsequent 3-strike sets. Soft start will be required at the beginning of each day's impact pile driving work and at any time following a cessation of impact pile driving of thirty minutes or longer; the requirement to implement soft start for impact driving is independent of whether vibratory driving has occurred within the prior 30 minutes.

All observers will be trained in marine mammal identification and behaviors and are required to have no other construction-related tasks while conducting monitoring.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In accordance with the Companion Manual and NAO 216–6A, we have determined that issuance of this final rule qualifies to be categorically excluded from further NEPA review. Issuance of this final rule is consistent with categories of activities identified in CE B4 of the Companion Manual and we have not identified any extraordinary circumstances listed in Chapter 4 of the Companion Manual that would preclude application of this CE. NMFS has prepared a CE memorandum for the record.

Navy is the sole entity that would be subject to the requirements of these regulations, and the U.S. Navy is not a small governmental jurisdiction, small organization, or small business, as defined by the RFA. No comments were received regarding this certification. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required and none has been prepared.

However, this rule does not contain a collection-of-information requirement subject to the provisions of the PRA because the applicant is a Federal agency.

A court order directs NMFS to reinstate the previous red snapper sector allocations, and the corresponding sector quotas (which are equivalent to the ACLs), to 51 percent commercial and 49 percent recreational. The intent of this final rule is to ensure that the regulations reflect the sector allocations and corresponding catch levels as required by the court order.

The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and is implemented by NMFS through regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t50/p622">50 CFR part 622</ref> under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). All weights for red snapper below apply as round weight.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Secretary of Commerce approved Amendment 28 to the FMP on <date date="2016-03-23">March 23, 2016</date>. The purpose of Amendment 28 was to reallocate the red snapper harvest consistent with the 2014 red snapper update assessment to ensure the allowable catch and recovery benefits from a rebuilding stock were fairly and equitably allocated between the commercial and recreational sectors to achieve optimum yield. On <date date="2016-04-28">April 28, 2016</date>, NMFS published a final rule implementing Amendment 28 (<ref href="/us/fr/81/25576">81 FR 25576</ref>).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The final rule for Amendment 28 revised the allocation of the red snapper ACL between the commercial and recreational sectors to be 48.5 percent and 51.5 percent, respectively, and consequently revised the commercial and recreational quotas and ACLs, as well as the recreational ACTs (<ref href="/us/fr/81/25576">81 FR 25576</ref>, <date date="2016-04-28">April 28, 2016</date>). However, a court decision in <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Guindon</inline> v. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Pritzker,</inline> 2017 <?page num="26377"?>WL 875775 (D.D.C. <date date="2017-03-03">March 3, 2017</date>), vacated Amendment 28 and its implementing final rule. The court order directs NMFS to reinstate the sector allocations of red snapper to 51 percent commercial and 49 percent recreational, which were in effect prior to the implementation of the Amendment 28 final rule. This results in a total commercial quota of 7,007,000 lb (3,178,000 kg) and a total recreational quota of 6,733,000 lb (3,054,000 kg). The total recreational quota is further divided to a private angling quota and ACT of 3,885,000 lb (1,762,000 kg), and 3,108,000 lb (1,410,000 kg), respectively; and a Federal for-hire component quota and ACT of 2,848,000 lb (1,292,000 kg), and 2,278,000 lb (1,033,000 kg), respectively. The recreational component quotas and ACTs are in effect through the 2022 fishing year.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">All other provisions that are currently applicable to the Gulf reef fish fishery and red snapper remain unchanged as a result of this final rule.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Assistant Administrator for NOAA Fisheries (AA) has determined that this final rule is consistent with the <date date="2017-03-03">March 3, 2017</date>, court order, the FMP, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable laws.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Because this rulemaking is required by court order and prior notice and opportunity for public comment are not required under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553">5 U.S.C. 553</ref>, or any other law, the regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s603–605">5 U.S.C. 603–605</ref>, do not apply to this final rule. In addition, because the changes required by the court order that are identified in this final rule are non-discretionary, the National Environmental Policy Act does not apply to this final rule.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The AA finds good cause to waive notice and public comment on this action because it is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest, as provided by <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/B">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)</ref>. This action is limited in scope and ensures that the regulatory text provides accurate information to the regulated public that is consistent with a Federal court order. NMFS does not have discretion to take other action, as there is no alternative to complying with the requirements of the court order.


</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Furthermore, the AA finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in effectiveness, as provided by <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/d/3">5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)</ref>, as such delay would be contrary to the public interest because the measures contained in this final rule are necessary to ensure that the Gulf reef fish fishery is conducted in compliance with a Federal court order. If the requirements are not implemented immediately, then red snapper harvest will not be managed in accordance with the court order.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The NCUA Board (Board) proposes to adopt procedures to govern appeals to the Board that would apply to agency regulations that currently have their own embedded appeals provisions and will replace those current provisions. The procedures would apply in cases in which a decision rendered by a regional director or other program office director is subject to appeal to the Board. The proposed procedures are intended to result in greater efficiency, consistency, and better understanding of the way in which matters under covered regulations may be appealed to the Board.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Excluded from the scope of this proposal are formal adjudications required under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to be accompanied by “notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record.” Matters that are not covered include formal enforcement actions, challenges to orders imposing prompt corrective action and matters that are within the jurisdiction of the NCUA's Supervisory Review Committee (SRC). With the issuance of this proposed rule, the Board is also proposing a new rule to govern the SRC, including the appeal to the Board of adverse determinations made by the SRC.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">If adopted, new part 746, subpart B will govern most authorized appeals to the Board of adverse determinations made at program office levels under agency regulations that permit such an appeal. The agency's discussion of the proposed changes details which rules would be affected but the Board specifically requests comments on any other agency rules that should provide for an appeal and thus be covered under the proposal. The following actions or determinations would not be covered under the proposal because appeals relating to them are already covered under different agency procedures but the Board nonetheless seeks comments on their proposed exclusion:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Formal enforcement actions;
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Creditor claims in liquidation, to the extent that the claimant has requested and the Board has agreed to consider the appeal formally on the record;
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Material supervisory determination within the jurisdiction of the Supervisory Review Committee, including appeals of SRC determination to the Board (addressed under a separate agency proposal issued with this proposal);

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Board is committed to providing credit unions, and other persons or entities that are affected by agency decisions, with an opportunity to obtain meaningful review of those decisions. At present, procedures for obtaining that review are embedded in and scattered throughout NCUA's regulations and, in many cases, are slightly different from one another. For example, time frames for seeking higher level review may differ and deadlines within which final agency action is to be rendered may also be different.<ref id="fnd3e118" idref="fnd3e124" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref> In this proposal, the Board has developed a more uniform set of procedures to govern those rules in which an appeal to the Board is permitted. The Board seeks to strike a balance that will afford the appellant fair consideration of the issues while avoiding procedures that are overly burdensome, time consuming, and expensive for either the petitioner or the agency. The Board invites comment on all aspects of this proposal.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Several NCUA regulations contain appeals procedures in addition to their substantive provisions. These procedures generally lack uniformity and may be confusing for those seeking an appeal. To improve the appeals process that applies under the covered rules, the Board proposes to promulgate a more uniform set of appeals procedures contained in subpart B of part 746 to replace the current inconsistent appeals procedures that now apply to agency determinations under the affected regulations. The Board proposes to include in each of the affected rules a cross-reference to the proposed procedures to be located in subpart B of part 746.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The first section of proposed subpart B to part 746 states the Board's authority for issuing the rule as well as its scope and purpose.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Board is issuing this proposed rule pursuant to authority granted to it by secs. 120, 207, and 209 of the FCU Act. Section 120 of the FCU Act is a general grant of regulatory authority over FCUs. Section 207 of the FCU Act is a specific grant of authority over share insurance coverage, conservatorships, and liquidations. Section 209 of the FCU Act is a plenary grant of regulatory authority to issue rules and regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out its role as share insurer for all FICUs.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As stated above, the purpose of the proposed rule is to provide uniform procedures for appeals to the Board under affected agency regulations. The Board believes the creation of uniform rules will help ensure that appellants receive appropriate due process and that agency decisions are made in a prompt and efficient manner.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Section 746.201(c) Scope
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Paragraph (c) first lists each of the regulations with current appeal procedures that would be covered under the new rule. The section would also clarify that there are five categories of agency actions that are excluded from the scope of the rule. Because this rule would only apply to informal agency adjudications, formal adjudications would be excluded. Likewise, creditor claim appeals where the claimant has requested a hearing on the record would be excluded. In addition, the rule would not cover appeals of prompt corrective action determinations or material <?page num="26382"?>supervisory determinations appealable to NCUA's SRC. Finally, the rule would not cover the appeal of FOIA determinations, Privacy Act determinations, or determinations made under NCUA's <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Touhy</inline> regulation.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In § 746.202, the Board proposes to define certain terms. Unless otherwise defined, the Board expects FICUs and other affected parties to interpret terms or phrases according to their plain meaning.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Initial Agency Determination
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed rule would define “initial agency determination” to clarify that the rule only applies to certain agency decisions made by personnel below the Board level. The rule does not apply to any action that results in the formulation of a rule, regulation, guidance document, or policy statement.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Petitioner
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The term “petitioner” would refer to a natural person or legal entity seeking review of an initial agency determination. Several of NCUA's regulations use different terminology when referring to parties appealing determinations to the Board. For example, a party appealing the denial a creditor claim is a “claimant,” <ref id="fnd3e839" idref="fnd3e849" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">57</ref> while a party appealing a denial of share insurance coverage is referred to as an “accountholder.” <ref id="fnd3e843" idref="fnd3e858" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">58</ref> Rather than use all of these different terms, the Board is proposing to adopt a uniform term to describe all classes of individuals or legal entities appealing determinations to the Board.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Similarly, the Board is proposing to adopt a uniform term “program office” to refer to all offices within NCUA responsible for making initial agency determinations. Several NCUA offices below the Board level are responsible for administering various NCUA regulations. For example, chartering and field of membership determinations are made by OCFPA, while waivers and safety and soundness determinations are made by the appropriate regional office or ONES. Rather than use different terminology, the Board is proposing to adopt “program office” as a uniform term to describe the different NCUA offices responsible for making initial agency determinations.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed § 746.203 would set forth procedures for requesting reconsideration from a program office prior to filing an appeal with the Board. Several regulations issued by the NCUA Board permit affected parties to request reconsideration. This process is a useful, relatively inexpensive, and efficient method of resolving most disputes. It also limits the overall number of matters appealed to the Board. Therefore, the Board proposes to make this optional procedure available for any matter that could otherwise be appealed to the Board under part 746, subpart B and seeks comments on this approach.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Section 746.203(a) Reconsideration
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The reconsideration process promotes greater efficiency by allowing matters to be resolved at the program office level where possible. In general, the Board anticipates that the disposition of a request for reconsideration will either resolve the matter entirely or clarify the issues that remain for resolution at the Board level. Ordinarily, the Board anticipates that one request for reconsideration will be sufficient, and that the next appropriate step for a party still seeking resolution of the issues will be to appeal to the Board. The rule recognizes, however, that there may be cases involving extenuating circumstances, such as the discovery of new evidence or documentation, and that a second request for reconsideration may be appropriate in such circumstances. Absent such circumstances, a second request for reconsideration would be treated as an appeal to the Board.

 </heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Paragraph (e) would require the program office to issue a written determination within 30 calendar days of receiving a first request for reconsideration. Paragraph (f) would specify that the written determination must include a description of any right to appeal a determination to the Board. In the case of creditor claims, paragraph (f)(2) would require a description of the right to file or continue a lawsuit in federal court.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the Board's experience, 30 calendar days is a sufficient amount of time for a program office to consider new information and reach a determination after reconsideration. If the program office fails to make a determination within 30 calendar days, proposed paragraph (g) would treat the request for reconsideration as if it had been denied. To avoid undue prejudice, the denial of a request for reconsideration is treated as an initial agency determination for purposes of the deadline to file an appeal with the Board in proposed § 746.204. If the petitioner obtains new information or there are reasonable, mitigating circumstances that precluded the presentation of existing information in connection with the first request for reconsideration, as determined solely by the program office in its reasonable judgment, the petitioner may request a second reconsideration prior to a Board appeal.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed § 746.204 would state the procedures for filing an appeal with the Board. The provision would also list the information that must be included as part of the appeal. These requirements would be similar to the current requirements for creditor claims and share insurance claims, including the requirement that any appeal must be filed with the Secretary of the Board within 60 calendar days of the date of the initial agency determination or, if applicable, any determination following a request for reconsideration. However, the Board may grant extensions for timely filing in response to a petitioner's request base on the petitioner's reasonable, extenuating circumstances.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In order to establish subject matter jurisdiction, federal courts typically require affected parties to exhaust administrative remedies.<ref id="fnd3e895" idref="fnd3e905" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">59</ref> For example, in creditor and share insurance cases, the failure to exhaust administrative remedies is a jurisdictional bar preventing affected parties from seeking judicial review of their claims in federal court.<ref id="fnd3e899" idref="fnd3e922" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">60</ref> Proposed paragraph (c) would clarify that, absent mitigating circumstances, a petitioner who fails to file a timely request for an appeal would be considered to have waived claims that may be adjudicated under part 746, subpart B.

In the discretion of the Chairman, the time for the Board's decision may be extended as the Chairman may consider necessary or appropriate for a full and fair consideration of the issues, including accommodation of an oral hearing. If the Board does not reach a decision within 90 calendar days from the date of receipt, or within any extension of time as established by the Chairman, the appeal will be deemed to be denied. The deadline will help ensure that the Board has adequate time to decide a matter on appeal while avoiding any undue prejudice to petitioners from unnecessary delays.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires NCUA to prepare an analysis to describe any significant economic impact a rule may have on a substantial number of small entities (primarily those under $100 million in assets). This proposed rule only provides enhanced voluntary opportunities for credit unions to appeal agency determinations. Accordingly, it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small credit unions, and therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required.

For purposes of the PRA, a paperwork burden may take the form of a either a reporting or a recordkeeping requirement, both referred to as information collections. Proposed new Subpart B to part 746 establishes procedures by which credit unions or other entities affected by an initial decision by an NCUA program office may seek and obtain the review of that decision by the NCUA Board.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The rule proposes to consolidate the information collection requirements of the informal appeals process under a new part; as such, NCUA intends to remove the burden allocated to the appeals process currently under OMB control numbers 3133–0141, –0127, –0114, –0117, –0133, and –0138, upon promulgation of this new rule, and requests a new OMB control number for the information collection requirements under part 746.

Within 45 calendar days of receipt of a completed waiver request, including all necessary supporting documentation and, if appropriate, any written concurrence, the regional director will provide the federally insured credit union a written response. The regional director's decision will be based on safety and soundness and other considerations; however, the regional director will not grant a waiver to a federally insured, state-chartered credit union without the prior written concurrence of the appropriate state supervisory authority. A federally insured credit union may request the regional director to reconsider a denied waiver request and/or file an appeal with the NCUA Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart B to part 746 of this chapter.

The designation will remain in effect during the five-year period. If a federal credit union does not requalify and has secondary capital or nonmember deposit accounts with a maturity beyond the five-year period, NCUA may extend the time for a federal credit union to come into compliance with regulatory requirements to allow the federal credit union to satisfy the terms of any account agreements. A federal credit union may request NCUA to reconsider a determination that it no longer meets the criteria for the designation and/or file an appeal with the NCUA Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart B to part 746 of this chapter.

                                                <content> A claimant may either request agency review of an initial determination of the liquidating agent to disallow a claim or seek a de novo judicial determination of claims. In order to receive agency review of an initial determination, a claimant must request an administrative appeal before the NCUA Board. In order to seek a judicial determination, a claimant must file suit (or continue an action <?page num="26388"?>commenced before the appointment of the liquidating agent) in the district or territorial court of the United States for the district within which the credit union's principal place of business is located or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

The determination of whether to agree to a request for a hearing on the record shall rest solely with the NCUA Board, which shall notify the claimant of its decision in writing. Alternatively, a claimant may request an appeal before the NCUA Board pursuant to the procedures set forth in subpart B to part 746 of this chapter.

                                                <content> A claimant must request agency review of an initial determination or file suit (or continue an action commenced before the appointment of the liquidating agent) within 60 days from the mailing of the initial determination or the expiration of the time period for the liquidating agent to determine claims under § 709.6(c), whichever is earlier. A request for a hearing on the record will suspend the 60-day period for filing a lawsuit (or continuing an action commenced before the appointment of the liquidating agent) from the date of the claimant's request to the date of the NCUA Board's decision regarding that request. If a claimant fails to either request a hearing on the record or an appeal to the Board or file suit (or continue an action commenced before the appointment of the liquidating agent) within the 60-day period, any disallowance of claims shall be final and the claimant shall have no further rights or remedies with respect to such claims.

The deadline to request agency review or file suit (or continue an action commenced before the appointment of the liquidating agent) in paragraph (c) of this section will be suspended from the date of the claimant's request to the date of the liquidating agent's decision regarding that request.

The regional director may revoke approval of the branch office for failure to follow the business plan in a material respect or for substantive and documented safety and soundness reasons. If the regional director revokes the approval, the credit union will have six months from the date of the revocation letter to terminate the operations of the branch. The credit union can request reconsideration of the revocation and/or appeal this revocation to the NCUA Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart B to part 746 of this chapter.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The NCUA Board (Board) proposes to amend its procedures for appealing material supervisory determinations to the NCUA Supervisory Review Committee (SRC) to enhance due process and to be more consistent with the practices of the federal banking agencies. The proposed rule would expand the number of supervisory determinations appealable to the SRC and provide credit unions with the opportunity for additional review by the Director of the Office of Examinations and Insurance (E&amp;I). The Board proposes to codify these procedures of our regulations.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed rule would: (1) Expand the number of material supervisory determinations appealable to the SRC; (2) create an optional intermediate level of review before an appeal is brought to the SRC; and (3) change the nature and composition of the SRC. The proposed rule would be codified as Subpart A to part 746. The Board is requesting comment on all aspects of this proposed rule.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Based on NCUA's experience in administering the current appellate process, the Board believes that it would be efficient and beneficial if the SRC appeals process is more transparent and objective and if more material supervisory determinations are appealable to the SRC. The proposed rule would, therefore, redefine the term “material supervisory determination” to include supervisory determinations that may affect the capital, earnings, operating flexibility, or that may otherwise affect the nature and level of supervisory oversight of a federally insured credit union (FICU). Certain exceptions would be made for material supervisory determinations that are specifically excluded by the Riegle Act or where other appeals procedures exist.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Board is also proposing to add an optional intermediate level of review by the Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee, before a FICU appeals to the SRC. A decision by the Director of E&amp;I would be made in writing with no opportunity for oral presentations from either the petitioner or the program office. The Director of E&amp;I, in addition to his or her supervisory expertise, would have the ability to consult with the parties either jointly or separately before rendering a decision. If the FICU or program office is unsatisfied with the decision rendered by the Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee, either may appeal that decision to the SRC. This optional level of review provides enhanced due process to FICUs that wish to use it.

Likewise, in cases where the FICU requested review by the Director of E&amp;I, staff from E&amp;I would be ineligible to serve as SRC members for that appeal. The presence of two SRC members (physically, telephonically, or by video conference) would be required as a quorum, and a majority of votes present would be required for action on an appeal.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In § 746.102, the Board proposes to define certain terms. Unless defined, the Board expects FICUs and other affected parties to interpret terms or phrases consistently with the general definitions in § 700.2 of NCUA's regulations or, where not defined, according to their plain meaning.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The term “petitioner” refers to an entity, including a program office, requesting reconsideration or review, or filing an appeal pursuant to the procedures set forth in this subpart. As detailed more fully below, FICUs must first request reconsideration from the appropriate program office and then may request review from the Director of E&amp;I. Either a FICU or a program office may appeal a partial or complete adverse decision by the Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee, to the SRC. Similarly, either a FICU or program office may appeal a partial or complete adverse decision by the SRC to the Board. Recognizing that, depending on the procedural posture of a particular appeal, the entity requesting review may be either a FICU or a program office, the Board is proposing to adopt a uniform term to describe all entities requesting agency action on a particular matter.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Board is proposing to adopt a uniform term “program office” to refer to all offices within NCUA responsible for making material supervisory determinations. Several NCUA offices are responsible for administering various NCUA regulations. Rather than use different terminology, the Board is proposing to adopt “program office” as a uniform term to describe all of the different NCUA offices responsible for making material supervisory determinations.

Therefore, the Board is proposing to adopt a uniform term to describe all entities defending against a petitioner's action.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In response to proposed IRPS 94–2, several commenters argued that the additional disputes other than those specifically listed in the Riegle Act should be appealable to the SRC. In IRPS 95–1, however, the Board adopted a narrow definition of “material supervisory determination” in order to allow for the opportunity to gain experience with the SRC appeals process. Having administered SRC appeals for over 20 years, the Board has gained sufficient experience with the SRC appeals process and believes that expanding the jurisdiction of the SRC to be consistent with the federal banking agencies is now appropriate to provide FICUs with enhanced due process.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed § 746.103 defines the term “material supervisory determination” to mean a written decision by a program office (unless ineligible for appeal) that may significantly affect the capital, earnings, operating flexibility, or that may otherwise affect the nature and level of supervisory oversight of a FICU subject to the exclusions detailed below. Examples of material supervisory determinations include, but are not limited to, determinations related to the adequacy of loan loss reserve provisions; classification of loans and other assets that are significant to a FICU; and determinations related to restitution orders under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). This proposed definition is similar to the definition used by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).<ref id="fnd3e2278" idref="fnd3e2284" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">13</ref>

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed definition limits the ability to appeal CAMEL ratings to composite ratings. Component ratings would no longer be appealable to the SRC unless those ratings may affect the nature and level of supervisory oversight of a FICU. For example, if eligibility for an extended examination cycle is contingent on a component rating of 1 or 2 in management, a management rating of 3 would be appealable to the SRC. Based on its experience with administering the current appellate process, the Board does not believe that component ratings are “material” in most cases if the FICU otherwise maintains an overall composite CAMEL rating of 1 or 2. Therefore, the proposed definition of “material supervisory determination” limits the ability of FICUs to appeal examination ratings only to those cases where the FICU has received a composite rating of 3, 4, or 5, or a component rating that could trigger supervisory action.

Examiners are in the best position, in the first instance, to determine whether FCUs demonstrate clear and consistent patterns of TILA violations. Because review of these determinations requires consideration of the facts and circumstances before the examiner, the Board believes the SRC appeals process is the most appropriate method for considering these appeals before taking an appeal to the Board.

In other words, once an enforcement action is initiated, the SRC appeals process is suspended, regardless of how far along the FICU may be in that process, until the enforcement action is resolved.

Therefore, the Board proposes to place the burden of showing an error in an appealed determination on the petitioner. The objective of appellate review by the Director of E&amp;I, the SRC, and the Board is to ensure that the appealed determination is correct and not just reasonable. If the Director of E&amp;I, the SRC, or the Board, as applicable, determines that the appealed determination is incorrect upon their respective <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">de novo</inline> review, then they will render a corrected determination.

FICUs are encouraged to make good-faith efforts to resolve supervisory issues, including those concerning a material supervisory determination, at the most direct level possible, starting with their examiners or program office staff, and as efficiently as possible. If the Director of E&amp;I, the SRC, or the Board, as applicable, finds that a FICU has engaged in bad faith by knowingly withholding evidence from an examiner, the program office, the Director of E&amp;I, the SRC, or the Board, that withholding may serve as a basis for dismissing an appeal.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under the proposed rule, an appeal at any level would not affect, delay, or impede any formal or informal supervisory or enforcement action in progress, nor would it affect NCUA's authority to take any supervisory or enforcement action against a FICU. Unless otherwise specified in a written decision on appeal, the material supervisory determination would remain in effect until the SRC appeals process has been exhausted.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Likewise, under the proposed rule, an appeal would delay action on a waiver request or an application for additional authority that could be affected by the outcome of the appeal unless the FICU specifically requests that the waiver request or application for additional authority be considered notwithstanding the appeal. Any deadline for a program office to make a determination on a waiver request or application for additional authority set out in any part of NCUA's regulations would be suspended until the FICU has exhausted its administrative remedies under Subpart A or is no longer eligible to pursue an appeal. The purpose of this provision is to avoid situations where a FICU receives an adverse determination on a waiver request or an application for additional authority based on a material supervisory determination, only to have the material supervisory determination subsequently reversed by the SRC. It also prevents a waiver request or an application for additional authority from being automatically denied by operation of other parts of NCUA's regulations.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FICUs are encouraged to resolve supervisory issues with their examiners and other NCUA staff as efficiently as possible without the need to appeal supervisory matters to the SRC. The Board anticipates that most disputes will be handled in that manner. Proposed § 746.105 reflects this policy by requiring a FICU to request reconsideration of a material supervisory determination from the program office that rendered the determination and by establishing procedures that control such a request. The Director of E&amp;I or the SRC would only assume jurisdiction over a material supervisory determination after the FICU has requested reconsideration from the appropriate program office and that program office has had an opportunity to render a decision on that request.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As the Board explained in IRPS 94–2, it is NCUA policy that the SRC should only assume jurisdiction over a material supervisory determination after the FICU establishes that it has been unsuccessful in attempting to resolve the matter with the FICU's examiner or the appropriate program office. Early involvement by the Director of E&amp;I or the SRC would be disruptive to the established organizational structure of NCUA and the relationships between FICUs and NCUA program offices. Therefore, the Board believes that requesting reconsideration from the appropriate program office should continue to be a mandatory part of the process of appealing a material supervisory determination to the SRC.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Nevertheless, to avoid unnecessary delays, a second request for reconsideration will be treated as either a request for review by the Director of E&amp;I or an appeal to the SRC as determined by the Secretary of the Board after consultation with the petitioner. While the reconsideration process promotes greater efficiency by facilitating dispute resolution at the program office level, allowing multiple requests for reconsideration would be inefficient. Upon receiving a second request for reconsideration, the program office will forward that to the Secretary of the Board to be processed as either a request for review pursuant to § 746.106 or an appeal pursuant to § 746.107.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed § 746.106 provides an optional intermediate level of review by the Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee, before a FICU appeals a material supervisory determination to the SRC. The purpose of this intermediate level of review is to give FICUs another opportunity to resolve supervisory issues and to refine the issues that may be presented to the SRC and the Board on appeal. A request for review by the Director of E&amp;I must be in writing and filed with the Secretary of the Board.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Board believes that the Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee, is the appropriate official for these intermediate reviews because E&amp;I is NCUA's central office in charge of examination policy. E&amp;I staff are expert in nearly all examination-related matters. Additionally, E&amp;I is not in the direct line of supervision over any program office, thus avoiding any bias or predisposition to affirm a material supervisory determination by a program office.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under the proposed rule, the Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee, will issue a written decision based on written submissions by the FICU and the program office. The Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee, will have the ability to consult with parties jointly or separately before rendering a decision. Either the FICU or the program office will be able to appeal any adverse <?page num="26396"?>decision by the Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee, to the SRC.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Neither party may make a request for reconsideration of the decision rendered by the Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee. If a party disagrees with the decision rendered by the Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee, the next step for further review is to file an appeal to the SRC.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD3">Section 746.107 Procedures for Appealing to the Supervisory Review Committee
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Proposed § 746.107 codifies many of the existing procedures contained in IRPS 11–1, as amended by IRPS 12–1, and expands on them by permitting the SRC Chairman to: (1) Adopt supplemental rules governing its operations; (2) order that material be kept confidential; and (3) consolidate appeals that present similar issues of law or fact. The Board believes that with the expanded jurisdiction of the SRC, additional procedures may be necessary to address operational issues. For example, after some experience with the appeals process, the SRC Chairman may determine that supplemental rules allowing all appeals to be presented through teleconference rather than in person at NCUA headquarters are necessary to ensure that appeals are conducted efficiently and promptly. The proposed rule grants the SRC Chairman the flexibility to adopt such supplemental rules.








</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, proposed § 746.107 creates an explicit right for a FICU to request that an appeal be conducted entirely based on the written record. As the Board explained in IRPS 95–1, the decision of whether to make a personal appearance should be up to the FICU involved in a particular appeal because FICUs are responsible for all costs associated with a personal appearance. While IRPS 95–1 attempted to save resources of both FICUs and NCUA by permitting the SRC Chairman to work out disputes via teleconference, the Board believes that more can be done to provide enhanced due process. Therefore, the proposed rule explicitly grants FICUs the right to request that an appeal be conducted entirely based on the written record.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed rule also requires the SRC Chairman to notify the Director of E&amp;I of an appeal that involves the interpretation of material supervisory policy or generally accepted accounting principles and solicit input from E&amp;I on how to interpret the policy or accounting principle that applies to the subject matter of the appeal. E&amp;I staff are responsible for setting supervisory policy and interpreting accounting principles for NCUA. Therefore, it is appropriate to require the SRC to solicit input from the Director of E&amp;I and E&amp;I staff on these matters. Furthermore, the proposed rule requires the SRC Chairman to notify the General Counsel and solicit input from the Office of General Counsel on the interpretation of laws, including NCUA regulations, which may apply to the subject matter of an appeal. The Office of General Counsel serves as legal counsel for NCUA and, therefore, consultation with that office on these issues is necessary and proper.<ref id="fnd3e2425" idref="fnd3e2431" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">19</ref>

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed rule encourages a FICU to resolve supervisory matters as efficiently as possible by allowing the FICU to request an optional review by the Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee. Accordingly, for FICUs that have elected to request review by the Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee, the proposed rule suspends the deadline to file an appeal with the SRC until after the Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee, has rendered a decision. In practice, this means that a FICU could potentially delay the deadline to file an appeal with the SRC until after the Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee, has considered the matter. While this could potentially give FICUs additional time to file an appeal with the SRC, the Board believes that the potential benefits of reduced caseloads at the SRC and Board levels exceed any potential risks of delay, especially because material supervisory determinations would remain in place during the pendency of a review by the Director of E&amp;I, or his or her designee. Additionally, during this time, NCUA would not be prohibited from taking supervisory or enforcement actions.

The Special Counsel will serve as a permanent non-voting member of the SRC to advise the SRC on procedural and legal matters. When selecting SRC members to hear a particular appeal, the SRC Chairman will consider any real or apparent conflicts of interest that may impact the SRC member's objectivity as well as that individual's experience with the subject matter of the appeal. Members of the SRC pool from the program office rendering the material supervisory determination that is the subject of the appeal will be ineligible to serve as SRC members for that appeal. Likewise, E&amp;I staff will be ineligible to serve as SRC members for appeals where the FICU is appealing a determination following a request for review by the Director of E&amp;I.








</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Board believes that creating a rotating SRC pool of individuals eligible to serve on the SRC from among NCUA's senior staff in the regional offices, OED, E&amp;I, ONES, OSCUI, and OCFPA is appropriate because these individuals are well-suited to understand supervisory issues and render consistent, well-reasoned decisions. Senior staff from the regional offices, E&amp;I, and ONES are actively engaged in examination-related activities and have in-depth knowledge of current trends in the credit union industry. Likewise, senior staff from OSCUI have specialized knowledge of the needs of small and low-income FICUs. Moreover, senior staff from OCFPA have specialized knowledge of the latest issues in chartering, field of membership, and consumer protection. Each of these program offices brings a unique and diverse set of skills that will greatly benefit the SRC appeals process.

<?page num="26397"?></p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, expanding the number of individuals eligible to serve on the SRC enhances due process by eliminating the potential for conflicts of interest. Having a wider pool from which to draw when selecting SRC members allows the SRC Chairman to avoid conflicts of interest by selecting SRC members without any direct ties to the program office that rendered the material supervisory determination. Moreover, having additional members in the SRC pool means that the Board can expand the jurisdiction of the SRC, while still providing an expeditious process for a FICU to appeal a material supervisory determination.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Nevertheless, the Board continues to believe that regional directors and associate regional directors should not serve in the pool of individuals eligible to serve on the SRC. The Riegle Act mandated NCUA to establish an “independent appellate process,” which it defines as “a review by an agency official who does not directly or indirectly report to the agency official who made the material supervisory determination under review.” <ref id="fnd3e2468" idref="fnd3e2474" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">21</ref> This reflects a clear Congressional intent to afford a FICU a separate and meaningful appeal of a material supervisory determination. As the Board explained in IRPS 95–1, allowing regional directors and associate regional directors to serve as members of the SRC pool would place these individuals in the untenable position of potentially reviewing material supervisory determinations made by their colleagues. While the Board does not believe that these individuals would be predisposed to support other regional directors or associate regional directors, the Board wishes to eliminate any perception that the SRC appeals process may be biased against FICUs.

It also addresses timing requirements. A request for appeal must include a statement of facts on which the appeal is based, a statement of the petitioner's principal objections to the SRC's decision, and, for FICUs, a certification that the FICU's board of directors has authorized the appeal to be filed. The proposed rule cross references procedures set out in § 746.111 that must be followed to request an oral hearing.

Rather, at least one Board Member would be required to agree to hear an appeal from a decision by the SRC within 20 calendar days from the date the petitioner first filed the appeal with the Secretary of the Board. The purpose of this provision is to reserve Board review for only those cases involving significant issues of supervisory policy that cannot be addressed at the several lower appellate levels provided by this rule or through a request for reconsideration from the appropriate program office. At this stage, petitioners would have had the opportunity to obtain potentially three levels of review (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> reconsideration from the program office, review by the Director of E&amp;I or his or her designee, and appeal to the SRC). Therefore, the Board believes that limiting Board review to only certain matters is not unfairly prejudicial. Furthermore, if a request for an appeal is denied, the decision of the SRC would be treated as a final agency action permitting the petitioner to seek judicial review in federal court under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

Such a decision would constitute a final agency action permitting the petitioner to seek judicial review in federal court under the APA. If the Board does not reach a decision within 90 calendar days, unless otherwise extended, from the date of receipt, then it would be treated as a denial. Building this deadline into the rule ensures that the Board has adequate time to decide a matter on appeal while avoiding any undue prejudice to petitioners from unnecessary delays.

                                                   <content> The purpose of this subpart is to establish an expeditious review process for federally insured credit unions to appeal material supervisory determinations to an independent supervisory panel and, if applicable, to the NCUA Board.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We propose to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc. Model CL–600–1A11 (CL–600), CL–600–2A12 (CL–601 Variant), and CL–600–2B16 (CL–601–3A, CL–601–3R, and CL–604 Variants) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a new life limitation that has been introduced for the side brace fitting shaft and side brace-to-airplane fitting pin of the main landing gear (MLG). This proposed AD would require revising the maintenance or inspection program. This proposed AD would also require an inspection to identify the serial number, to serialize, and to record the accumulated life of the side brace fitting shaft of the MLG. We are proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

We are proposing this AD because we evaluated all pertinent information and determined an unsafe condition exists and is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type design.
</p>

Compliance with these actions is required by <ref href="/us/cfr/t14/s91.403/c">14 CFR 91.403(c)</ref>. For airplanes that have been previously modified, altered, or repaired in the areas addressed by this proposed AD, the operator may not be able to accomplish the actions described in the revisions. In this situation, to comply with <ref href="/us/cfr/t14/s91.403/c">14 CFR 91.403(c)</ref>, the operator must request approval for an alternative method of compliance according to paragraph (k)(1) of this proposed AD. The request should include a description of changes to the required actions that will ensure the continued operational safety of the airplane.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FAA is considering an amendment to <ref href="/us/cfr/t14">Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations</ref> (14 CFR) part 71 to amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface within a 7.7-mile radius of Thomas C Russell Field Airport, Alexander City, AL. The segment extending from the 7.7-mile radius of the airport to 7 miles south of the Alexander City NDB would be removed due to the decommissioning of the Alexander City NDB and cancellation of the NDB approach, and for continued safety and management of IFR operations at the airport. The geographic coordinates of the airport also would be adjusted to coincide with the FAAs aeronautical database.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>; (2) is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (<ref href="/us/fr/44/11034">44 FR 11034</ref>; <date date="1979-02-26">February 26, 1979</date>); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a Regulatory Evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this proposed rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This action is necessary due to the decommissioning of the Medford and Waupaca non directional radio beacons (NDB), and cancellation of NDB approaches. This action would enhance the safety and management of IFR operations at these airports.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is found in <ref href="/us/usc/t49">Title 49 of the United States Code</ref>. Subtitle I, Section 106 describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's authority. This rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that authority as it would amend controlled airspace in Class E to ensure the safety of IFR operations at Taylor County and Waupaca Municipal airports.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FAA is proposing an amendment to Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 71 by modifying Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Taylor County Airport in Medford WI. The Agency proposes to retain the current Class E airspace within a 6.8-mile radius of the airport and to remove the segment of airspace within 2.7 miles each side of the 162° bearing from the airport extending from the 6.8-mile radius to 7 miles southeast of the airport due to the decommissioning of the Medford NDB and cancellation of the NDB approach.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The agency also proposes to modify the Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Waupaca Municipal Airport, Waupaca, <?page num="26409"?>WI. The agency proposes to retain the current Class E airspace within a 6.4-mile radius of the airport and to remove the segment within 2.7 miles each side of the 118° bearing from the airport, extending from the 6.4-mile radius area to 7 miles southeast of the airport due to the decommissioning of the Waupaca NDB and cancellation of the NDB approach. This proposal would enhance the safety and management of the SIAPs for IFR operations at these airports.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Class E airspace designations are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.11A, dated <date date="2016-08-03">August 3, 2016</date></p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Regulatory Notices and Analyses
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current, is non-controversial and unlikely to result in adverse or negative comments. It, therefore: (1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>; (2) is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (<ref href="/us/fr/44/11034">44 FR 11034</ref>; <date date="1979-02-26">February 26, 1979</date>); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This action proposes to amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Hot Springs, VA, by adding controlled airspace for Bath Community Hospital Heliport to the Ingalls Field Airport airspace designation. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the heliport. This action also would update the geographic coordinates of Ingalls Field Airport in the associated Class E airspace.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FAA's authority to issue rules regarding aviation safety is found in <ref href="/us/usc/t49">Title 49 of the United States Code</ref>. Subtitle I, Section 106 describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the agency's authority. This proposed rulemaking is promulgated under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part <?page num="26410"?>A, Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that section, the FAA is charged with prescribing regulations to assign the use of airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. This regulation is within the scope of that authority as it would add Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Bath Community Hospital Heliport to the existing designation of Class E airspace at Ingalls Field Airport, Hot Springs, VA.

This action would accommodate new Area Navigation (RNAV) Global Positioning System Standard Instrument Approach Procedures at the heliport. Airspace reconfiguration is necessary for the safety and management of IFR operations at the heliport. The FAA also proposes to update the geographic coordinates of Ingalls Field Airport to coincide with the FAAs aeronautical database.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>; (2) is not a “significant rule” under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (<ref href="/us/fr/44/11034">44 FR 11034</ref>; <date date="1979-02-26">February 26, 1979</date>); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a Regulatory Evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this proposed rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

FEMA also proposes to modify its waiver of the Administrative Procedure Act exemption for matters relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, and contracts.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Paragraph (a) of current section 1.1 states that <ref href="/us/cfr/t44/p1">44 CFR part 1</ref> covers FEMA's basic policies and procedures for adoption of rules, and that it incorporates provisions of section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act. Section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553">5 U.S.C. 553</ref>) addresses Federal agency requirements for notice and comment rulemaking. Notice and comment rulemaking is also known as “informal rulemaking.” Paragraph (a) of current section 1.1 also includes a statement that <ref href="/us/cfr/t44/p1">44 CFR part 1</ref> and internal FEMA manuals implement <ref href="/us/eo/12291">Executive Order 12291</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FEMA proposes to limit the purpose of part 1 to describing FEMA's informal rulemaking procedures that affect the public. This proposed rule therefore does not describe FEMA's internal rulemaking procedures, which are more appropriately placed in internal guidance. FEMA proposes these changes for a number of reasons. First, the Administrative Procedure Act does not require internal agency procedure to be in regulation. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/a/2">5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2)</ref>, 553(b)(A). Second, and more importantly, the references to <ref href="/us/eo/12291">Executive Order 12291</ref> and implementing FEMA procedures are outdated. As noted above, <ref href="/us/eo/12291">Executive Order 12291</ref> has been revoked, and was replaced with <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>, “Regulatory <?page num="26412"?>Planning and Review.” <ref id="fnd3e4438" idref="fnd3e4444" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">3</ref> <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref> imposed major changes to the regulatory review process of the Federal government, such as establishing a definition of “significant” rulemakings and requiring a 90-day review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of those rulemakings.

The majority of these grant programs are annual grant programs, meaning Congress on an annual basis (1) appropriates a certain amount of money for the program, and (2) potentially revises requirements associated with the program.

However, it is now standard practice for Federal agencies to use the internet to disseminate information to the public. FEMA's use of its Web site and <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">www.grants.gov</inline> for its annual grant programs allows any member of the public easy access to grant application information, and inadequate notice is no longer an issue.

At this time, however, FEMA prefers to retain a statement in support of public participation in rulemaking, because although FEMA sees little reason to retain current paragraph 1.4(b) as drafted, FEMA continues to believe that public participation is frequently beneficial to the rulemaking process, particularly for its non-annual disaster grant programs. Accordingly, FEMA proposes to modify its part 1 with respect to the grants exception. Specifically, under this proposed rule (proposed section 1.3), FEMA would retain its general policy in favor of public participation, but would retain discretion to depart from this policy in its discretion and as circumstances warrant, such as with respect to annual grant programs. FEMA also proposes to include a provision stating that its general policy of providing for public participation in rulemaking is not intended to create a right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable against the United States.

Such a policy need not be in regulation.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FEMA proposes to remove paragraph (e) from current section 1.4, which contains FEMA's policy to hold a 60-day public comment period for notices of proposed rulemaking. This policy is consistent with the time period recommended by <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>. Paragraph (e) also states that the comment period will include any period of review required by OMB in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Such a policy need not be in regulation.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Paragraph (f) of current section 1.4 addresses Administrative Procedure Act provisions that allow an agency to bypass notice and comment. FEMA proposes to remove paragraph (f) from current section 1.4.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Paragraph (g) of current section 1.4 addresses the delayed effective date provision of the Administrative Procedure Act. Under this provision, a substantive rule generally becomes effective no earlier than 30 calendar days after the date of publication in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>, unless the agency provides an explanation in the preamble to the rule that it has good cause to make the rule effective immediately upon the date of publication.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Paragraph (h) of current section 1.4 addresses publication of rules in emergency situations. It states that part 1 does not apply to such situations, and any such regulation will be reported to OMB. It states that as soon as is practicable, FEMA will publish in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> a statement of the reasons why it is impracticable for the agency to follow the procedures of <ref href="/us/eo/12866">Executive Order 12866</ref>, and the agency shall prepare and transmit, as needed, and as soon as practicable, a regulatory impact analysis for the rule. FEMA proposes to remove this paragraph from section 1.4, because it predates the termination of FEMA's status as an independent agency, and addresses a matter of internal U.S. government coordination.

 </heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 1.5 addresses the public rules docket. FEMA proposes to renumber this section as section 1.4. FEMA proposes to slightly revise this section, to clarify that the public rulemaking docket is available for public inspection after a rule document has been published in the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>. This is the point when a public rulemaking docket is established. Prior to that point, any documents associated with the rulemaking are part of the internal development process, and are not included in the public docket. FEMA also proposes to clarify that the public docket is available in hard copy until the rule project is closed. Once a rule project is closed (either because the rule has been finalized or withdrawn), FEMA archives the docket at the National Archives and Records Administration, due to limited physical space at FEMA offices. An electronic copy of the docket would still be available on <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">www.regulations.gov,</inline> however, with the exception of any copyrighted material that might be associated with the rule project.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FEMA also proposes to add a requirement that any member of the public wishing to physically inspect the public docket do so by prearrangement with FEMA. FEMA has consolidated its office space and no longer maintains a separate reading room for rule dockets. Therefore, it is necessary for FEMA to reserve a space ahead of time for a member of the public to inspect the public docket. FEMA proposes to remove the requirement that a member of the public must pay a fee to obtain a copy of the public docket.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FEMA proposes to move the provision addressing the submission of public comments to a separate section, as it is not directly related to inspection of the public docket (although public comments are included in the docket itself). The new section addressing submission of public comments would <?page num="26414"?>be numbered section 1.5, and addresses submission of comments electronically to <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">www.regulations.gov</inline> as well as submission via mail or courier to FEMA.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Finally, FEMA proposes to add a section to address the public dockets for flood hazard elevation rules. The physical repository addresses for supporting material for those rules vary depend on the locality that is the subject of the rule. FEMA includes the address in the preamble to each flood hazard elevation rule.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Section 1.6 Ex Parte Communications
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 1.6 addresses ex parte communications during the rulemaking process. FEMA proposes to revise this section to cover written as well as oral communications, and to cover any such communications from outside the Federal Executive branch, rather than outside FEMA. There are various communications necessary outside FEMA but within the Federal Executive branch during the rulemaking process, such as with DHS, OMB, or other Federal agencies, as part of internal government review, to ensure consistency in Federal government policy, and to consult with other agencies with expertise in the subject of the rule or that may be affected by the rule. These communications are considered “internal” as they are contained within the Federal Executive branch. The disclosure requirements of this section are not intended to apply to such internal communications.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FEMA proposes to revise this section to cover communications from the time a notice of proposed rulemaking is published until FEMA issues a final regulatory action (such as a withdrawal of the notice of proposed rulemaking or a final rule). Under the current regulation, communication is only restricted during the open public comment period, which tends to defeat the purpose of transparency in development of the regulatory action, since once the comment period closes, ex parte communications can occur while the next regulatory action is being developed. To ensure transparency for the entire development of the rule from publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking until issuance of a final action, FEMA proposes to revise the applicability of its ex parte regulation to also cover the time between the close of a proposed rule comment period and the issuance of a final action.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FEMA proposes to remove the introductory language of this section, which states that the section applies to rulemaking proceedings governed by the procedural requirements of <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553">5 U.S.C. 553</ref> (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> informal rulemaking). The purpose section of part 1 already limits the scope of part 1 to informal rulemaking so this introductory language to section 1.6 is unnecessary.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FEMA proposes to add a provision noting that the ex parte restrictions do not apply to Tribal consultations. <ref href="/us/eo/13175">Executive Order 13175</ref>, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments,<ref id="fnd3e4645" idref="fnd3e4655" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">10</ref> and Presidential Memorandum of <date date="2009-11-09">November 9, 2009</date>, Tribal Consultation,<ref id="fnd3e4649" idref="fnd3e4660" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">11</ref> require Federal agencies to consult with Tribes on actions that have Tribal implications. In order to facilitate and support these communications, FEMA encourages Tribal consultation early in the rule development process and does not impose ex parte restrictions on such consultations.

These requirements have been replaced by a series of executive orders and OMB Circular A–4, “Regulatory Analysis.” A copy of the circular is included in the docket for this rulemaking. FEMA must follow these guidelines when preparing a regulatory impact analysis for its rules.

FEMA's process for initiating a rule is an internal agency matter, and the ultimate authority for initiating a rule resides with the Administrator. Thus, FEMA proposes to remove reference to the internal process for initiating a rule from its regulations. Initiation of a rule via a petition for rulemaking is addressed in a separate section (current section 1.18, which is renumbered as section 1.8 in this proposed rule).

FEMA proposes to remove this provision because such a target, announced in a proposed rule, would too frequently be unduly speculative. For instance, FEMA does not presume that each proposed rule will result in a final rule.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Paragraph (d)(1) states that before approving any final major rule, FEMA will make a determination that the regulation is clearly within the authority delegated by law and consistent with congressional intent and include in the  <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>  at the time of promulgation a memorandum of law supporting that determination. FEMA proposes to remove this provision because it no longer reflects FEMA practice. FEMA includes the legal authority for the rule in the rulemaking document, and this is also a requirement of the  <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>  (each rulemaking must include an “authority citation”). Although FEMA internally makes a legal determination that the regulation is within FEMA's legal authorities, FEMA does not include in the  <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline>  a memorandum of law supporting that determination.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 1.17 states that FEMA will not consider petitions for reconsideration of a final rule, and that such petitions will be treated as petitions for rulemaking. This remains FEMA's policy, and FEMA proposes no revisions to this section, other than to revise the reference to section 1.18, which would become section 1.9 if this proposed rule is finalized.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD2">Section 1.18 Petitions for Rulemaking
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 1.18 addresses petitions for rulemaking. It states that any interested person may petition the Administrator for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule, and for purposes of this section, the term “person” includes a “Federal, State, or local government or government agency.” FEMA proposes to revise the definition of “person” to include “any member of the public and any entity outside the Federal Executive branch.” FEMA considers any “petitions” from entities of the Federal <?page num="26416"?>Executive branch as internal to the government and not subject to the same requirements as petitions from the public. There is communication amongst Federal Executive branch agencies on a regular basis and any need for a rule would be raised through those channels. This is not a change from the current intent of this section, but FEMA is proposing this new language for the sake of clarity.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This section states that petitions should be submitted to the “Rules Docket Clerk.” As FEMA no longer has a “Rules Docket Clerk,” FEMA proposes to change this to the “Regulatory Affairs Division,” which is the division responsible for processing any petitions to FEMA for rulemaking. FEMA also proposes to require that petitions for rulemaking be labeled as such, to avoid situations where simple correspondence is confused with a petition.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FEMA proposes to revise the authority citation for part 1 by removing the reference to rescinded <ref href="/us/eo/12291">Executive Order 12291</ref>, as well as the references to the Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1978, <ref href="/us/eo/12127">Executive Order 12127</ref>, and <ref href="/us/eo/12148">Executive Order 12148</ref>. The Reorganization Plan and Executive Orders 12127 and 12148 established FEMA as an agency in 1979 and established its functions. FEMA proposes to replace these cites with a citation to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, <ref href="/us/usc/t6/s101">6 U.S.C. 101</ref> <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">et seq.,</inline> which provided organic authority for FEMA and made it a component of the Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Homeland Security Delegation 9001.1, which delegated specific functions back to FEMA.

Accordingly, OMB has not reviewed it. As this rule is not a significant regulatory action, this rule is exempt from the requirements of <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref>. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> OMB's Memorandum “Guidance Implementing <ref href="/us/eo/13771">Executive Order 13771</ref>, Titled `Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs' ” (April 5, 2017).

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), as amended, <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s601–612">5 U.S.C. 601–612</ref>, agencies must consider the impact of their rulemakings on “small entities” (small businesses, small organizations and local governments). When the Administrative Procedure Act requires an agency to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking under <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553">5 U.S.C. 553</ref>, the RFA requires a regulatory flexibility analysis for both the proposed rule and the final rule if the rulemaking could “have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.” The RFA also provides that in lieu of a regulatory flexibility analysis, the agency may certify in the rulemaking document that the rulemaking will not “have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities” along with a statement providing the factual basis for such certification. FEMA has voluntarily published a notice of proposed rulemaking in this case, notwithstanding that this rule is a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice exempt from notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s553/b/A">5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A)</ref>.

This rule does not impose direct costs on small entities. Accordingly, and although FEMA is not required to make such certification, pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s605/b">5 U.S.C. 605(b)</ref>, the Administrator of FEMA certifies that this rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant <?page num="26417"?>economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

If the rulemaking includes a Federal mandate, the Act requires an agency to prepare an assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of the Federal mandate. The Act also pertains to any regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect small governments. Before establishing any such requirements, an agency must develop a plan allowing for input from the affected governments regarding the requirements.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FEMA has determined that this rule will not result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, nor by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or more in any one year as a result of a Federal mandate, and it will not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. Therefore, no actions are deemed necessary under the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.

Under this Executive Order, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, no agency shall promulgate any regulation that has Tribal implications, that imposes substantial direct compliance costs on Indian Tribal governments, and that is not required by statute, unless funds necessary to pay the direct costs incurred by the Indian Tribal government or the Tribe in complying with the regulation are provided by the Federal Government, or the agency consults with Tribal officials.

Under the RFA, we must either prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis or certify that the regulation, if put in place, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for any regulation proposed after <date date="1981-01-01">January 1, 1981</date>. Section 602 of the RFA requires that NMFS issue an Agenda of Regulations identifying rules under development that are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The purpose of the review is to determine whether existing rules should be left unchanged, or whether they should be revised or rescinded to minimize significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small entities, consistent with the objectives of other applicable statutes. In deciding whether change is necessary, the RFA establishes five factors that NMFS must consider:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(1) Whether the rule is still needed;

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(3) The complexity of the rule;
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(4) How much the rule overlaps, duplicates or conflicts with other Federal rules, and, to the extent feasible, with State and local governmental rules; and
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(5) How long it has been since the rule has been evaluated or how much the technology, economic conditions, or <?page num="26420"?>other factors have changed in the area affected by the rule.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Below is the list of rules and their summaries issued in 2010 that we will review by <date date="2017-12-31">December 31, 2017</date>, consistent with RFA Section 610. This list includes rules issues in 2010 for which initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses were completed.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">1. Pacific Halibut Fisheries; Limited Access for Guided Sport Charter. RIN 0648–AW92 (<ref href="/us/fr/75/553">75 FR 553</ref>; <date date="2010-01-05">January 5, 2010</date>). NMFS issued regulations creating a limited access system for charter vessels in the guided sport fishery for Pacific halibut in waters of International Pacific Halibut Commission Regulatory Areas 2C (Southeast Alaska) and 3A (Central Gulf of Alaska). This limited access system limited the number of charter vessels that may participate in the guided sport fishery for halibut in these areas. NMFS issued a charter halibut permit to a licensed charter fishing business owner based on his or her past participation in the charter halibut fishery and to a Community Quota Entity representing specific rural communities. All charter halibut permit holders were subject to limits on the number of permits they may hold and on the number of charter vessel anglers who may catch and retain halibut on permitted charter vessels. This action was necessary to achieve the approved halibut fishery management goals of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. The intended effect was to curtail growth of fishing capacity in the guided sport fishery for halibut. This action was conducted by NMFS under authority of the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">2. International Fisheries; Western and Central Pacific Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species; Initial Implementation of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention. RIN 0648–AV63 (<ref href="/us/fr/75/3335">75 FR 3335</ref>; <date date="2010-01-21">January 21, 2010</date>). NMFS issued regulations under authority of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention Implementation Act, which authorized the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate regulations needed to carry out the obligations of the U.S. under the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, including implementing the decisions of the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. The regulations included requirements related to permitting, vessel monitoring systems, vessel observers, vessel markings, reporting and recordkeeping, at-sea transshipment, and boarding and inspection on the high seas, among others. NMFS has determined that this action was necessary for the United States to satisfy its international obligations under the Convention, to which it is a Contracting Party. It has the effect of requiring that all relevant U.S. fishing vessels were operated in conformance with the provisions of the Convention.

NMFS issued this final rule to amend the regulations implementing the Harbor Porpoise Take Reduction Plan to address the increased incidental mortality and serious injury of the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy stock of harbor porpoises (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Phocoena phocoena</inline>) in gillnet fisheries throughout the stock's U.S. range. This action was conducted by NMFS under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

NMFS implemented approved measures in Amendment 10 to the Atlantic Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish (MSB) Fishery Management Plan (FMP). Amendment 10 was developed by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council to bring the FMP into compliance with Magnuson-Stevens Act requirements by establishing a rebuilding program that allows the butterfish stock to rebuild and protects the long-term health and stability of the stock; and by minimizing bycatch and the fishing mortality of unavoidable bycatch, to the extent practicable, in the MSB fisheries. Amendment 10 increased the minimum codend mesh size requirement for the long fin squid fishery; established a butterfish rebuilding program with a butterfish mortality cap for the long fin squid fishery; established a 72-hr trip notification requirement for the long fin squid fishery; and required an annual assessment of the butterfish rebuilding program by the Council's Scientific and Statistical Committee. This rule also made minor, technical corrections to the existing regulations. This action was conducted by NMFS under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

Amendment 16 was developed by the New England Fishery Management Council as part of the biennial adjustment process in the FMP to update status determination criteria for all regulated NE multispecies and ocean pout stocks; to adopt rebuilding programs for NE multispecies stocks newly classified as being overfished and subject to overfishing; and to revise management measures, including significant revisions to the sector management measures, necessary to end overfishing, rebuild overfished regulated NE multispecies and ocean pout stocks, and mitigate the adverse economic impacts of increased effort controls. This final rule also implemented new requirements under Amendment 16 for establishing acceptable biological catch (ABC), annual catch limits (ACLs), and accountability measures (AMs) for each stock managed under the FMP, pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Finally, this action added Atlantic wolffish to the list of species managed by the FMP. This action was necessary to address the results of the most recent stock assessment, which indicate that several additional regulated species are overfished and subject to overfishing, and that stocks currently classified as overfished require additional reductions in fishing mortality to rebuild by the end of their rebuilding periods. This action was conducted by NMFS under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Act

(<ref href="/us/fr/75/21512">75 FR 21512</ref>; <date date="2010-04-26">April 26, 2010</date>). NMFS issued this final rule to implement Amendment 31 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. This final rule implemented restrictions applicable to the bottom longline component of the reef fish fishery in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The restrictions included a bottom longline endorsement requirement, a seasonal closed area, and a limitation on the number of hooks that can be possessed and fished. The intent of this rule was to balance the continued operation of the bottom longline component of the reef fish fishery in the eastern Gulf while maintaining adequate protective measures for sea turtles. This action was conducted by NMFS under <?page num="26421"?>the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

NMFS published this final rule to implement the Final Amendment 3 to the Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP). As it developed Amendment 3, NMFS examined a full range of management alternatives available to rebuild blacknose sharks and end overfishing of blacknose and shortfin mako sharks, consistent with recent stock assessments, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable law, and evaluated options for managing smooth dogfish as a highly migratory species under the HMS FMP. This final rule implemented the final conservation and management measures in Amendment 3 for blacknose sharks, shortfin mako sharks, and smooth dogfish. In order to reduce confusion with spiny dogfish regulations, this final rule places both smooth dogfish and Florida smoothhound into the “smoothhound shark complex.” This final rule also announced the opening date and 2010 annual quotas for small coastal sharks. These changes could have affected all fishermen, commercial and recreational, who fish for sharks in the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. This action was conducted by NMFS under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

This final Endangered Species Act (ESA) section 4(d) rule represented the regulations that we, NMFS, believe necessary and advisable to conserve the threatened Southern Distinct Population Segment of North American green sturgeon (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Acipenser medirostris</inline>; hereafter Southern DPS). We applied the prohibitions listed under ESA section 9 for the Southern DPS, and we highlighted specific categories of activities that were likely to result in take of Southern DPS fish. We did not find it necessary and advisable to apply the take prohibitions to certain categories of activities that contribute to conserving the Southern DPS. We also provided a variety of methods by which take of the Southern DPS may have been authorized. This document also announces the availability of a final environmental assessment that analyzed the environmental impacts of promulgating the 4(d) regulations for the Southern DPS. This action was conducted by NMFS under the authority of the ESA.

NMFS issued regulations amending the limited access program for charter vessels in the guided sport fishery for Pacific halibut in the waters of International Pacific Halibut Commission Regulatory Area 2C (Southeast Alaska) and Area 3A (Central Gulf of Alaska). These regulations revised the method of assigning angler endorsements to charter halibut permits to more closely align each endorsement with the greatest number of charter vessel anglers reported for each vessel that a charter business used to qualify for a charter halibut permit. This action was necessary to achieve the halibut fishery management goals of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. This action was conducted by NMFS under authority of the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982.

NMFS issued a final rule that implemented Amendment 94 to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area. Amendment 94 required participants using nonpelagic trawl gear in the directed fishery for flatfish in the Bering Sea subarea to modify the trawl gear to raise portions of the gear off the ocean bottom. Amendment 94 also changed the boundaries of the Northern Bering Sea Research Area to establish the Modified Gear Trawl Zone (MGTZ) and to expand the Saint Matthew Island Habitat Conservation Area. Nonpelagic trawl gear also was required to be modified to raise portions of the gear off the ocean bottom if used in any directed fishery for groundfish in the MGTZ. This action was necessary to reduce potential adverse effects of nonpelagic trawl gear on bottom habitat, to protect additional blue king crab habitat near St. Matthew Island, and to allow for efficient flatfish harvest as the distribution of flatfish in the Bering Sea changes. This action was intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the FMP, and other applicable laws. This action was conducted by NMFS under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

NMFS issued this final rule that implemented a regulatory amendment to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Fishery of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands prepared by the Caribbean Fishery Management Council. This rule modified the Bajo de Sico seasonal closure from a 3-month closure to a 6-month closure, and prohibits fishing for and possession of Caribbean reef fish in or from the EEZ portion of Bajo de Sico during the closure. The final rule also prohibited anchoring in the EEZ portion of Bajo de Sico year-round. In addition to the measures contained in the regulatory amendment, this final rule also added spear to the list of allowable gears in the commercial sector of the Caribbean reef fish fishery and revises the title of the FMP in the list of authorized fisheries and gear. The intended effect of this rule was to provide further protection for red hind spawning aggregations and large snappers and groupers, and better protect the essential fish habitat where these species reside. This action was conducted by NMFS under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

NMFS issued this final rule to implement actions identified in a regulatory amendment to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish <?page num="26422"?>Resources of the Gulf of Mexico prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. This final rule reduced the commercial quota for red grouper and, thus, the combined commercial quota for shallow water grouper species, and requires vessels with valid commercial Gulf of Mexico reef fish permits to mark their buoy gear with the official vessel number. This rule also implemented minor revisions to codified text, including a revised definition of buoy gear, re-codification of the commercial and recreational quotas for greater amberjack, revision of the recreational accountability measure for greater amberjack, and removal of outdated language for the red snapper individual fishing quota program. The intended effect of this final rule was to help prevent overfishing of red grouper while achieving optimum yield by reducing red grouper harvest, consistent with the findings of the recent stock assessment for this species, and to implement technical corrections to the regulations.

This final rule established opening dates and adjusted quotas for the 2011 fishing season for sandbar sharks, non-sandbar large coastal sharks (LCS), blacknose shark, non-blacknose small coastal shark (SCS), blue sharks, porbeagle sharks, and pelagic sharks (other than porbeagle or blue sharks) based on any over- and/or underharvests experienced during the 2009 and 2010 Atlantic commercial shark fishing seasons. NMFS was taking this action to establish the 2011 adjusted fishing quotas and to open the commercial fishing seasons for the Atlantic sandbar shark, non-sandbar LCS, blacknose shark, non-blacknose SCS, and pelagic shark fisheries based on over- and underharvests from the 2009 and 2010 fishing season. This action was expected to affect commercial shark fishermen in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions. In addition to establishing opening dates and adjusting annual quotas, this final rule implemented adaptive management measures, including flexible opening dates for the fishing season, as well as inseason adjustments to shark trip limits, to provide flexibility in management in the furtherance of equitable fishing opportunities, to the extent practicable, for commercial shark fishermen in all regions and areas. These actions were expected to affect commercial shark fishermen in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions. This action was conducted by NMFS under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

NMFS issued this final rule to implement Amendment 17A to the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region (FMP), as prepared and submitted by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council. This final rule established an ACL of zero for red snapper, which means all harvest and possession of red snapper in or from the South Atlantic EEZ is prohibited, and for a vessel with a Federal commercial or charter vessel/headboat permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper, harvest and possession of red snapper is prohibited in or from State or Federal waters. This rule also implemented an area closure for South Atlantic snapper-grouper that extends from southern Georgia to northern Florida where harvest and possession of all snapper-grouper species is prohibited (except when fishing with black sea bass pots or spearfishing gear for species other than red snapper), and requires the use of non-stainless steel circle hooks when fishing for snapper-grouper species with hook and line gear north of 28 degrees N. latitude in the South Atlantic EEZ. Additionally, Amendment 17A established a rebuilding plan for red snapper and requires a monitoring program as the AM for red snapper. The intended effects of this rule were to end overfishing of South Atlantic red snapper and rebuild the stock. This action was conducted by NMFS under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

State agencies are responsible for oversight and administration of the CNPs, including monitoring program operations and distributing Federal cash reimbursements and USDA Foods. CNPs are operated by a variety of local public and private providers that enter into agreements with State agencies, including school food authorities, local government agencies, nonprofit sponsoring organizations, child care centers, and adult care centers, among others.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">State agencies that administer these CNPs include Education, Agriculture, Health, and Human Services and Social Services agencies. In some States, all of these CNPs are administered by one State agency (Education or Agriculture), while in other States two or more agencies administer these programs. For example, in several States the agency that administers the FDP for schools is different than the agency that administers the other CNPs.

It also provides USDA with authority to decide how to allocate remaining funds, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> the “discretionary” allocation. Program regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t7/s235.4">7 CFR 235.4</ref> include the statutory allocation formula as well as the formula USDA adopted for discretionary allocation of the funds. The Act also sets funds availability at two years, authorizes a reallocation process for unused funds, and requires a State plan for use of the funds, approved by FNS. SAE funds can be spent on reasonable, allocable, and necessary expenses incurred by the State including, but not limited to, salary and benefits, staff training, office equipment, support services, travel, monitoring and technical assistance activities. Funds that are not used by a State are returned for reallocation to other States; by law, no more than 20 percent of the initial allocation may be carried over by a State to the next fiscal year. Finally, the Act imposes a “State Funding Requirement,” under which States must contribute no less than their level of contribution in Fiscal Year 1977 to the SAE budget.

Through the forms in this information collection, GIPSA's Packers and Stockyards Program (P&amp;SP) gathers information that keeps P&amp;SP current on the ownership and operations of regulated entities which permit P&amp;SP oversight of the regulated entities. For example, P&amp;SP gathers information regarding the number of head of livestock purchased and the cost of the livestock to determine if the entity is adequately bonded to protect the livestock sellers. The information regarding the amount of livestock purchased is also consolidated for public reporting in GIPSA's annual report. Other financial information is gathered to determine if the regulated entities are operating while solvent as required by the P&amp;S Act. This information collection is necessary for GIPSA to monitor and examine financial, competitive, and trade practices in the livestock, meat packing and poultry industries. The purpose of this notice is to solicit comments from the public concerning GIPSA's information collection.

Federal procurement standards prohibit transactions that involve a real or apparent conflict of interest for owners, employees, officers, agents, or their immediate family members having a financial or other interest in the outcome of the project; or that restrict open and free competition for unrestrained trade. Specifically, project funds may not be used for services or goods going to, or coming from, a person or entity with a real or apparent conflict of interest, including, but not limited to, owner(s) and their immediate family members. Examples of conflicts of interest include using grant funds to pay a member of the applicant's board of directors to provide proposed Technical Assistance to Socially-Disadvantaged Groups; pay a cooperative member to provide proposed Technical Assistance to other members of the same cooperative; and pay an immediate family member of the applicant to provide proposed Technical Assistance to Socially-Disadvantaged Groups.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZ) Board by the City of Waterville, Maine, grantee of FTZ 186, requesting production authority on behalf of Flemish Master Weavers (FMW), located within Subzone 186A in Sanford, Maine. The application conforming to the requirements of the regulations of the FTZ Board (<ref href="/us/cfr/t15/s400.23">15 CFR 400.23</ref>) was docketed on <date date="2017-04-18">April 18, 2017</date>.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FMW facility (127 employees, 4.08 acres) is used for the production of machine-made woven area rugs. FMW already has restricted FTZ authority to produce area rugs using polypropylene and polyester yarns in privileged foreign status (<ref href="/us/cfr/t19/s146.41">19 CFR 146.41</ref>), which precludes inverted tariff benefits on those inputs (see <ref href="/us/fr/81/51850">81 FR 51850</ref>, <date date="2016-08-05">August 5, 2016</date>).
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The pending application requests authority for FMW to use imported continuous filament polypropylene yarn in non-privileged foreign status (<ref href="/us/cfr/t19/s146.42">19 CFR 146.42</ref>). If the application were approved, on its domestic sales, FMW would be able to choose the duty rate during customs entry procedures that applies to machine-made woven area rugs (duty free) for the imported continuous filament polypropylene yarn (otherwise dutiable at 8%). Customs duties also could possibly be deferred or reduced on foreign-status production equipment. The request indicates that the savings from FTZ procedures would help improve the plant's international competitiveness.

</subject>

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZ) Board by the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, grantee of FTZ 19, requesting authority to reorganize the zone under the alternative site framework (ASF) adopted by the FTZ Board (15 CFR Sec. 400.2(c)). The ASF is an option for grantees for the establishment or reorganization of zones and can permit significantly greater flexibility in the designation of new subzones or “usage-driven” FTZ sites for operators/users located within a grantee's “service area” in the context of the FTZ Board's standard 2,000-acre activation limit for a zone. The application was submitted pursuant to the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (<ref href="/us/usc/t19/s81a–81u">19 U.S.C. 81a–81u</ref>), and the regulations of the Board (<ref href="/us/cfr/t15/p400">15 CFR part 400</ref>). It was formally docketed on <date date="2017-05-15">May 15, 2017</date>.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">FTZ 19 was approved by the FTZ Board on <date date="1983-01-27">January 27, 1983</date> (Board Order 204, <ref href="/us/fr/48/5772">48 FR 5772</ref>, <date date="1983-02-08">February 8, 1983</date>). The current zone includes the following sites: <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Site 1</inline> (17 acres)—Cargo Zone, LLC, 6200 North 16th Street, Omaha; and, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Site 2</inline> (38 acres)—Riverfront Industrial Park, Abbott Drive and Crown Point Avenue, Omaha.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The grantee's proposed service area under the ASF would be Burt, Cass, Dodge, Douglas, Sarpy, Saunders and Washington Counties, Nebraska, as described in the application. If approved, the grantee would be able to serve sites throughout the service area based on companies' needs for FTZ designation. The application indicates that the proposed service area is within and adjacent to the Omaha, Nebraska U.S. Customs and Border Protection port of entry.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The applicant is requesting authority to reorganize its existing zone to include both sites as “magnet” sites. The ASF allows for the possible exemption of one magnet site from the “sunset” time limits that generally apply to sites under the ASF, and the applicant proposes that Site 1 be so exempted. No subzones/usage-driven sites are being requested at this time. The application would have no impact on FTZ 19's previously authorized subzone.

The notification conforming to the requirements of the regulations of the FTZ Board (<ref href="/us/cfr/t15/s400.22">15 CFR 400.22</ref>) was received on <date date="2017-04-12">April 12, 2017</date>.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Valeo already has authority to produce air-conditioner compressor assemblies for motor vehicles. The current request would add certain foreign-status components to the scope of authority. Pursuant to <ref href="/us/cfr/t15/s400.14/b">15 CFR 400.14(b)</ref>, additional FTZ authority would be limited to the specific foreign status components described in the submitted notification (as described below) and subsequently authorized by the FTZ Board.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Production under FTZ procedures could exempt Valeo from customs duty payments on the foreign status components used in export production. On its domestic sales, Valeo would be able to choose the duty rates during customs entry procedures that apply to air-conditioner compressor assemblies and electromagnetic compressor/clutch assemblies in the company's existing scope of authority (duty rate ranges from free to 3.1%). Customs duties also could possibly be deferred or reduced on foreign-status production equipment.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The components sourced from abroad include: Stainless steel bolts; stainless steel screws (less than and more than 6mm in diameters); and, electromagnetic shims and rings (duty rate ranges from free to 8.5%).
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Public comment is invited from interested parties. Submissions shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is <date date="2017-07-17">July 17, 2017</date>.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A copy of the notification will be available for public inspection at the Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, Room 21013, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1401 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230–0002, and in the “Reading Room” section of the Board's Web site, which is accessible via <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">www.trade.gov/ftz.</inline>

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The statute and the Department's regulations do not directly address the establishment of rates to be applied to companies not selected for individual examination where the Department limits its examination in an administrative review pursuant to section 777A(e)(2) of the Act. However, the Department normally determines the rates for cooperative non-selected companies in reviews in a manner that is consistent with sections 703(d) and 705(c)(5)(A) of the Act, which provide that the Department shall determine an estimated all-others rate for companies not individually examined. This rate shall be an amount equal to the weighted average of the estimated subsidy rates established for those companies individually examined, excluding any zero and <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">de minimis</inline> rates and any rates based entirely on facts available under section 776 of the Act. However, if the countervailable subsidy rates established for all exporters and producers individually investigated are zero or <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">de minimis,</inline> or are determined entirely based on facts available under section 776 of the Act, the Department may use any reasonable method to establish the all-others rate. In past reviews, the Department has determined that a reasonable method to use when all the rates of selected mandatory respondents are zero, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">de minimis</inline> or determined entirely on facts available, is to assign non-selected respondents the average of the most recently determined rates that are not zero, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">de minimis,</inline> or based entirely on facts available.<ref id="fnd2e2045" idref="fnd2e2065" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">11</ref> Because all individually calculated rates in this review are based entirely on facts available, we have preliminarily based the rate for cooperative non-selected companies on the rate established for cooperative non-selected companies in <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Aluminum Extrusions 2014 Review,</inline>

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">All deadlines for the submission of comments or actions by the Department discussed below refer to the number of calendar days from the applicable starting date.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the event the Department limits the number of respondents for individual examination for administrative reviews initiated pursuant to requests made for the orders identified below, the Department intends to select respondents based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data for U.S. imports during the period of review. We intend to release the CBP data under Administrative Protective Order (APO) to all parties having an APO within five days of publication of the initiation notice and to make our decision regarding respondent selection within 21 days of publication of the initiation <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> notice. Therefore, we encourage all parties interested in commenting on respondent selection to submit their APO applications on the date of publication of the initiation notice, or as soon thereafter as possible. The Department invites comments regarding the CBP data and respondent selection within five days of placement of the CBP data on the record of the review.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In the event the Department decides it is necessary to limit individual examination of respondents and conduct respondent selection under section 777A(c)(2) of the Act:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In general, the Department finds that determinations concerning whether particular companies should be “collapsed” (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> treated as a single entity for purposes of calculating antidumping duty rates) require a substantial amount of detailed information and analysis, which often require follow-up questions and analysis. Accordingly, the Department will not conduct collapsing analyses at the respondent selection phase of a review and will not collapse companies at the respondent selection phase unless there has been a determination to collapse certain companies in a previous segment of this antidumping proceeding (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> investigation, administrative review, new shipper review or changed circumstances review). For any company subject to a review, if the Department determined, or continued to treat, that company as collapsed with others, the Department will assume that such companies continue to operate in the same manner and will collapse them for respondent selection purposes. Otherwise, the Department will not collapse companies for purposes of respondent selection. Parties are requested to (a) identify which companies subject to review previously were collapsed, and (b) provide a citation to the proceeding in which they were collapsed. Further, if companies are requested to complete a Quantity and Value Questionnaire for purposes of respondent selection, in general each company must report volume and value data separately for itself. Parties should not include data for any other party, even if they believe they should be treated as a single entity with that other party. If a company was collapsed with another company or companies in the most recently completed segment of a proceeding where the Department considered collapsing that entity, complete quantity and value data for that collapsed entity must be submitted.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Pursuant to <ref href="/us/cfr/t19/s351.213/d/1">19 CFR 351.213(d)(1)</ref>, a party that requests a review may withdraw that request within 90 days of the date of publication of the notice of initiation of the requested review. The regulation provides that the Department may extend this time if it is reasonable to do so. In order to provide parties additional certainty with respect to when the Department will exercise its discretion to extend this 90-day deadline, interested parties are advised that, with regard to reviews requested on the basis of anniversary months on or after June 2017, the Department does not intend to extend the 90-day deadline unless the requestor demonstrates that an extraordinary circumstance prevented it from submitting a timely withdrawal request. Determinations by the Department to extend the 90-day deadline will be made on a case-by-case basis.

For both antidumping and countervailing duty reviews, the interested party must specify the individual producers or exporters covered by an antidumping finding or an antidumping or countervailing duty order or suspension agreement for which it is requesting a review. In addition, a domestic interested party or an interested party described in section 771(9)(B) of the Act must state why it desires the Secretary to review those particular producers or exporters. If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by an exporter (or a producer if that producer also exports merchandise from other suppliers) which was produced in more than one country of origin and each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically, on an order-by-order basis, which exporter(s) the request is intended to cover.

Moreover, if the interested party who files a request for review is unable to locate the producer or exporter for which it requested the review, the interested party must provide an explanation of the attempts it made to locate the producer or exporter at the same time it files its request for review, in order for the Secretary to determine if the interested party's attempts were reasonable, pursuant to <ref href="/us/cfr/t19/s351.303/f/3/ii">19 CFR 351.303(f)(3)(ii)</ref>.

However, in that situation, because no review of the NME entity was conducted, the NME entity's entries were not subject to the review and the rate for the NME entity is not subject to change as a result of that review (although the rate for the individual exporter may change as a function of the finding that the exporter is part of the NME entity). Following initiation of an antidumping administrative review when there is no review requested of the NME entity, the Department will instruct CBP to liquidate entries for all exporters not named in the initiation notice, including those that were suspended at the NME entity rate.

We intend to place the CBP data on the record within five days of publication of the initiation notice and to make our decision regarding respondent selection within 30 days of publication of the initiation <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-4">Federal Register</inline> notice. Comments regarding the CBP data and respondent selection should be submitted seven days after the placement of the CBP data on the record of this review.

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In general, the Department has found that determinations concerning whether particular companies should be “collapsed” (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> treated as a single entity for purposes of calculating antidumping duty rates) require a substantial amount of detailed information and analysis, which often require follow-up questions and analysis. Accordingly, the Department will not conduct collapsing analyses at the respondent selection phase of this review and will not collapse companies at the respondent selection phase unless there has been a determination to collapse certain companies in a previous segment of this antidumping proceeding (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> investigation, administrative review, new shipper review or changed circumstances review). For any company subject to this review, if the Department determined, or continued to treat, that company as collapsed with others, the Department will assume that such companies continue to operate in the same manner and will collapse them for respondent selection purposes. Otherwise, the Department will not collapse companies for purposes of respondent selection. Parties are requested to (a) identify which companies subject to review previously were collapsed, and (b) provide a citation to the proceeding in which they were collapsed. Further, if companies are requested to complete the Quantity and Value (Q&amp;V) Questionnaire for purposes of respondent selection, in general each company must report volume and value data separately for itself. Parties should not include data for any other party, even if they believe they should be treated as a single entity with that other party. If a company was collapsed with another company or companies in the most recently completed segment of this proceeding where the Department considered collapsing that entity, complete Q&amp;V data for that collapsed entity must be submitted.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In proceedings involving non-market economy (NME) countries, the Department begins with a rebuttable presumption that all companies within the country are subject to government control and, thus, should be assigned a single antidumping duty deposit rate. It is the Department's policy to assign all exporters of merchandise subject to an administrative review in an NME country this single rate unless an exporter can demonstrate that it is sufficiently independent so as to be entitled to a separate rate.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">To establish whether a firm is sufficiently independent from government control of its export activities to be entitled to a separate rate, the Department analyzes each entity exporting the subject merchandise. In accordance with the separate rates criteria, the Department assigns separate rates to companies in NME cases only if respondents can demonstrate the absence of both <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">de jure</inline> and <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">de facto</inline> government control over export activities.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Young children's social, emotional, and behavioral development has long been recognized as critical for school readiness. Children who are socially competent and exhibit positive behavior during the early childhood years are more successful in school and in life (Jones, Greenberg, &amp; Crowley, 2015). Despite this, early childhood programs that serve infants, toddlers, and preschool children (young children) with, and at risk for, developmental delays or disabilities have struggled to systematically promote positive social and emotional development and reduce challenging behaviors.






 



</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Early childhood personnel are often not trained to adequately support young children's social, emotional, and behavioral development (Buettner, Hur, Jeon, &amp; Andrews, 2016). As a result, early childhood personnel frequently report that coping with challenging behavior is their most pressing training need and presents a barrier to including young children with disabilities into programs with their typically developing peers (Hemmeter, Corso, &amp; Cheatham, 2006; Snell et al., 2012). In fact, expulsion rates in preschool are higher than in K–12, and preschool expulsion and suspension rates include stark racial and gender disparities, with young boys of color, including those with disabilities, being suspended and expelled much more frequently than other children (Gilliam, 2005; U.S. Department of Education, 2014; U.S. Department of Education, 2016). In addition, young children with disabilities and their families face significant barriers to accessing inclusive high-quality early childhood programs, despite the research base on the benefits of and the legal foundation for inclusion.<ref id="fnd2e5493" idref="fnd2e5499" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref>

Section 619 of the IDEA Part B requires that to the maximum extent appropriate, all children with disabilities, including preschool children with disabilities, must be educated in the least restrictive environment, and removal from the regular education environment occurs only if the nature and severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.</p>

However, State and local early childhood programs are not typically organized in a manner that systematically supports early childhood personnel in implementing these interventions. State and local programs need guidance and resources on how to implement the framework, especially in home-based and community settings with young children with, and at risk for, developmental delays or disabilities.

MTSS strategies are typically organized into three progressively intensive tiers, with specific interventions being executed across primary, secondary and tertiary tiers. The first tier typically includes practices to promote nurturing and responsive caregiving relationships with the child and high-quality supportive environments. The second tier includes explicit instruction in social skills and emotional regulation for children who require more systematic and focused instruction. The third tier is for children with persistent challenging behaviors that are not responsive to interventions at other tiers and involves implementing a plan of intensive, individualized interventions. MTSS intervention strategies should not delay or deny the evaluation of students suspected of having a disability or developmental delay (see OSEP's April 2016 memorandum on the use of RTI in preschool available online: <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www2.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/idea/memosdcltrs/oseprtipreschoolmemo4-29-16.pdf</inline>).</p>

The standing panel requirements under section 682(b) of IDEA also have placed additional constraints on the availability of reviewers. Therefore, the Department has determined that for some discretionary grant competitions, applications may be separated into two or more groups and ranked and selected for funding within specific groups. This procedure will make it easier for the Department to find peer reviewers by ensuring that greater numbers of individuals who are eligible to serve as reviewers for any particular group of applicants will not have conflicts of interest. It also will increase the quality, independence, and fairness of the review process, while permitting panel members to review applications under discretionary grant competitions for which they also have submitted applications.

This helps the Department assess the impact of its information collection requirements and minimize the public's reporting burden. It also helps the public understand the Department's information collection requirements and provide the requested data in the desired format. ED is soliciting comments on the proposed information collection request (ICR) that is described below. The Department of Education is especially interested in public comment addressing the following issues: (1) Is this collection necessary to the proper functions of the Department; (2) will this information be processed and used in a timely manner; (3) is the estimate of burden accurate; (4) how might the Department enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (5) how might the Department minimize the burden of this collection on the respondents, including through the use of information technology. Please note that written comments received in response to this notice will be considered public records.

These systems provide services to eligible individuals with disabilities to protect their legal and human rights. Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) uses the form to meet specific data collection requirements of Section 509 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (the act), and its implementing federal regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t34/p381">34 CFR part 381</ref>. PAIR programs must report annually using the form, which is due on or before December 30 each year. Form RSA–509 has enabled RSA to furnish the President and Congress with data on the provision of protection and advocacy services and has helped to establish a sound basis for future funding requests. These data also have been used to indicate trends in the provision of services from year-to-year.

Data from the form have been used to evaluate individual programs. These data also have been used to indicate trends in the provision of services from year-to-year. In addition, Form RSA–227 is used to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of individual Client Assistance Program (CAP) grantees. These agencies provide services to individuals seeking or receiving services from programs and projects authorized by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. Form RSA–227 has enabled RSA to furnish the President and Congress with data on the provision of advocacy services and has helped to establish a sound basis for future funding requests.

Since its inception in 1995, TIMSS has continued to assess students every 4 years. The United States will participate in TIMSS 2019 to continue to monitor the progress of its students compared to that of other nations and to provide data on factors that may influence student achievement. New in 2019, TIMSS will be a technology-based assessment conducted in an electronic format. TIMSS is designed by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), and is conducted in the U.S. by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). In preparation for the TIMSS 2019 main study, in April-May 2017, U.S. participated in a pilot study to assist in the development of eTIMSS and, in March through April 2018, U.S. will <?page num="26467"?>participate in a field test to evaluate new assessment items and background questions. The TIMSS 2019 Main Study data collection will take place from April through May 2019, with recruitment beginning in spring 2018. This request is to conduct the TIMSS 2019 field test and to begin recruitment of schools, teachers, and students for the main study. In November 2017, NCES will submit a request for the TIMSS 2019 Main Study data collection.

The HEAL program provided federally insured loans to students in certain health professions disciplines, and these forms are used in the administration of the HEAL program. The Lender's Application for Insurance Claim is used by the lending institution to request payment of a claim by the Federal Government. The Request for Collection Assistance form is used by the lender to request proclaims assistance from the Department. Section 525 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, transferred the collection of the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program loans from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to the U.S. Department of Education (ED).

Although prior studies of academic language instruction provide some initial evidence of the efficacy of instructional practices, confirmation of large-scale effectiveness is needed. This evaluation will contribute to the knowledge base of the instructional practices that improve language and literacy outcomes for these high need populations.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This submission covers data collection for the baseline period prior to implementing the selected academic language intervention, during the implementation year (the 2017–18 school year), and a follow-up year (spring 2019). The evaluation will examine the implementation and impact of an academic language program, using a random assignment design in which participating schools in each district are randomly assigned to a treatment group whose 4th and 5th grade teachers receive training and materials to implement the program or to a control group whose teachers do not. This submission covers the following data collection activities: Teacher surveys, teacher and student rosters, and school district records data.

This data collection is a customized APR that goes beyond the generic 524B APR to facilitate the collection of more standardized and comprehensive data to inform GPRA, to improve the overall quality of data collected, and to increase the quality of data that can be used for evaluation and to inform policy decisions.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This notice announces receipt of a petition from Acuity Brands (Acuity) seeking a waiver from specific portions of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure for determining the energy consumption of illuminated exit signs. Acuity seeks to use an alternate test procedure to address issues involved in testing certain basic models of illuminated exit signs identified in its petition. Acuity contends that its combination illuminated exit signs cannot be accurately tested using the currently applicable DOE test procedure. Although Acuity has proposed an alternate test procedure, DOE is proposing a different alternate test procedure to test and rate specified Acuity basic models in this notice. DOE solicits comments, data, and information concerning Acuity's petition and DOE's proposed alternate test procedure.

The basic models of illuminated exit signs at issue are models typically known as combination illuminated exit signs. These basic models include components such as egress lighting or alarms that typically require a larger battery to power the auxiliary features, which causes the test procedure to provide inaccurate comparative data.

Acuity has further stated that it is not feasible to separate the power measurement associated with the exit signage and the egress lighting because a single battery and charging circuit supplies power for both functions.

Acuity also requested that any new products introduced by the company into commerce that provide the dual function of exit signage and emergency egress lighting be covered by the waiver. DOE regulations at <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s430.27/f/2">10 CFR 430.27(f)(2)</ref> provide that DOE may grant a waiver, including adherence to alternate test procedures, only for “the basic model(s) for which the waiver was requested.” Acuity may request to extend the scope of a waiver to additional basic models pursuant to <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s431.401/g">10 CFR 431.401(g)</ref> by identifying the particular basic models for which a waiver is requested, but the present waiver, if granted, would extend to only those basic models identified in the updated waiver petition currently under consideration.

                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">III. Alternate Test Procedure
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Upon review of the alternate test procedure submitted by Acuity in its petition for wavier, DOE found that “rated wattage of light source(s)” associated with the face and egress light source(s), respectively, is not always well documented in Acuity's product literature for the basic models under consideration. A lack of data in the manufacturer data sheet with respect to the wattage of the light source(s) prevents the accurate and repeatable calculation of the combination illuminated exit sign input power demand in Acuity's proposed test procedure. Therefore, DOE is proposing alternate test procedures that provide methods to test and rate the basic models at issue without the rated wattage of the light source(s).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">DOE investigated various approaches to isolate the input power used to illuminate only the exit sign portion of a combination exit sign: Including disconnecting the battery; scaling or prorating the portion of the input power demand associated with the battery; and measuring alternative power quantities as a proxy for input power demand. DOE tentatively concluded that these methods would require isolating the battery power used to illuminate the faces of the exit sign from the battery power used to operate auxiliary features. Based on DOE's review of combination exit signs, DOE has tentatively determined that it is either not possible to measure the required quantities or that doing so would require cutting of wires and modifying the circuitry of the combination exit sign.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">DOE reviewed the basic models submitted in Acuity's petition for waiver and updated basic model list provided in Acuity's email submitted to DOE on <date date="2017-05-01">May 1, 2017</date>, and determined that the basic models in the waiver are comprised of two sub-varieties: (A) Combination illuminated exit signs with equivalent non-combination versions <ref id="fnd2e7251" idref="fnd2e7258" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">6</ref> and (B) Combination illuminated exit signs without equivalent non-combination versions.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Illuminated Exit Signs are covered under the Energy Policy &amp; Conservation Act (EPCA) as amended by Section 135 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005). This product category was included in EPA's Energy Star program and the intent of the EPAct 2005 amendment was to make the Energy Star program's product regulated by EPCA. The test procedures adopted by Congress for this product category is the Energy Star program (v. 2.0) test procedures, and the energy conservation standards are the performance requirements for the Energy Star program (v. 2.0). See <ref href="/us/usc/t42/s6293/b/9">42 U.S.C. 6293(b)(9)</ref> and 6295(w).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">When Illuminated Exit Signs were included in EPAct 2005, the industry interpretation was based on a scope consistent with the Energy Star program covering products that provided <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">only</inline> the functional characteristics defined in the regulation to illuminate the signage itself, with no expressed intent to also regulate energy used for emergency egress lighting. The statutory definition of illuminated exit sign (<ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s431.202">10 CFR 431.202</ref>) includes the phrase “consists of electrically powered <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">integral</inline> light source that—(i) illuminates the legend `EXIT' and any directional indica-<?GPOnewLine?>tors . . .”
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Certain basic models of illuminated exit signs provide the dual function of exit signage and lighting for emergency egress (combo unit). However, the battery used in a combo unit requires a substantially larger capacity to provide a minimum of 90 minutes of egress lighting as required by life safety code, as well as illuminating the EXIT legend and directional indicators. Because of this, the test procedures when applied to a combo unit do not accurately represent the energy consumption associated with illuminating the exit sign legend.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A combo unit utilizes a higher capacity battery to power <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">both</inline> the exit sign face(s) as well as emergency egress lighting during a power outage. While § 431.202 indicates that the input power demand shall be measured with batteries at full charge, the higher capacity dual function battery for a combo unit results in a higher power than a smaller battery utilized in a unit that provides only the exit signage functionality.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The performance specification for the input power described in the Energy Star specifications limits the power to illuminate <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">the face</inline> of the exit sign with no reference to power associated with the emergency egress lighting. The test procedure for Energy Star 2.0 requires the measurement of power including the internal battery, but the power limits were not established using a baseline for units that provide the dual function associated with a combo unit. For a combo unit, it is not feasible to separate the power measurement associated with the exit signage and the egress lighting since a single battery and charging circuit supplies power for both functions.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Alternate Test Procedure for Combo Units
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">There are no nationally recognized test procedures to measure the power for a combo unit that describes the power associated only with illuminating the face(s) of the exit sign. Therefore Acuity Brands is submitting the following alternate test procedure to accurately represent the power of a combo unit used to illuminating the legend `EXIT', directional indicators and proportional battery power for the face(s) of the exit sign.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For combination exit and egress lighting units (combo units), the power shall be determined by the following procedure:

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Acuity Brands is submitting this request for a test procedure waiver for combo units that provide the dual function of exit signage and emergency egress lighting. The waiver request has outlined that:
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">1. The prescribed test procedures are based on power intended only to illuminate the face of the exit sign and will evaluate the basic models of combo units in a manner unrepresentative of their true energy consumption characteristics
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">2. the prescribed test procedures will evaluate the basic models of combo units in a manner that results in materially inaccurate comparative data, and
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">3. there are no existing industry standards that define test procedures to measure the energy consumption characteristics for a combo unit that is associated with only the exit sign face(s), and
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">4. the alternate test procedure proposed by Acuity Brands for combo units will accurately describe the power to illuminate the face of the exit and the proportion of battery charging circuit power used to illuminate the face(s) of the exit during a power outage.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Based on DOE general counsel guidance on waivers issued <date date="2010-12-23">December 23, 2010</date>, it is our understanding that DOE has made a commitment to (1) act promptly on waiver requests and to update its test procedures to address granted waivers going forward and (2) prevent the administrative waiver process from delaying or deterring the introduction of novel, innovative products into the marketplace and as a matter of enforcement policy will refrain from enforcement actions related to pending waiver requests.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Thank you in advance for your prompt consideration of this waiver request.</p>

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2017-01-18">January 18, 2017</date>, Merchant Hydro Developers, LLC, filed an application for a preliminary permit, pursuant to section 4(f) of the Federal Power Act (FPA), proposing to study the feasibility of the Meyersdale Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Project to be located in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. The sole purpose of a preliminary permit, if issued, is to grant the permit holder priority to file a license application during the permit term. A preliminary permit does not authorize the permit holder to perform any land-disturbing activities or otherwise enter upon lands or waters owned by others without the owners' express permission.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed project would consist of the following: (1) A new upper reservoir with a surface area of 45 acres and a storage capacity of 675 acre-feet at a surface elevation of approximately 2,790 feet above mean sea level (msl) created through construction of a new roller-compacted concrete or rock-filled dam and/or dike; (2) excavating a new lower reservoir with a surface area of 30 acres and a total storage capacity of 810 acre-feet at a surface elevation of 2,100 feet msl; (3) a new 5,500-foot-long, 48-inch-diameter penstock connecting the upper and lower reservoirs; (4) a new 150-foot-long, 50-foot-wide powerhouse containing two turbine-generator units with a total rated capacity of 38 megawatts; (5) a new transmission line connecting the powerhouse to a nearby electric grid interconnection point at the Meyersdale Wind Farm; and (6) appurtenant facilities. Possible initial fill water and make-up water would come from the nearby Casselman River, including groundwater. The proposed project would have an annual generation of 139,369 megawatt-hours.

A headwater benefits charge and the cost incurred by the Commission to complete an evaluation are paid by downstream hydropower project owners. In essence, the owners of non-federal hydropower projects that directly benefit from a headwater improvement must pay an equitable portion of the annual charges for interest, maintenance, and depreciation of the headwater project to the U.S. Treasury. The regulations provide for apportionment of these costs between the headwater project and downstream projects based on downstream energy gains and propose equitable apportionment methodology that can be applied to all river basins in which headwater improvements are built. The Commission requires owners of non-federal hydropower projects to file data for determining annual charges as outlined in 18 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11.

The gathering facilities proposed to be abandon are located on Transco's Central Texas Gathering System (CTGS) in federal waters offshore Texas.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Specifically, Transco proposes to abandon the CTGS West Facilities that consist of: (i) A 10.72-mile, 20-inch offshore gathering lateral extending from Brazos Block A–133A platform to the Brazos Block A–76 subsea tie-in, and (ii) a 30-mile, 20-inch offshore gathering lateral extending from the Brazos Block A–76 subsea tie-in to the Brazos Block 538 platform. Transco states that the abandonment of the CTGS West Facilities will have no impacts on the upstream shippers as the approximately 35,000 dekatherms per day that currently flows on these laterals will be re-routed to an existing parallel line. Transco estimates the cost of the abandonment of the CTGS West Facilities to be approximately $2.9 million, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. The filing may also be viewed on the web at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">http://www.ferc.gov</inline> using the “eLibrary” link. Enter the docket number excluding the last three digits in the docket number field to access the document. For assistance, contact FERC at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">FERCOnlineSupport@ferc.gov</inline> or call toll-free, (866) 208–3676 or TYY, (202) 502–8659.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Any questions regarding this application should be directed to Charlotte Hutson, Director Rates &amp; Regulatory, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC, P.O. Box 1396, Houston, Texas 77251–1396, by telephone at (713) 215–4060, or by email at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">charlotte.a.hutson@williams.com.</inline>
                                 </p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Pursuant to section 157.9 of the Commission's rules (<ref href="/us/cfr/t18/s157.9">18 CFR 157.9</ref>), within 90 days of this Notice, the Commission staff will either: Complete its environmental assessment (EA) and place it into the Commission's public record (eLibrary) for this proceeding; or issue a Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review. If a Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review is issued, it will indicate, among other milestones, the anticipated date for the Commission staff's issuance of the EA for this proposal. The filing of the EA in the Commission's public record for this proceeding or the issuance of a Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review will serve to notify federal and state agencies of the timing for the completion of all necessary reviews, and the subsequent need to complete all federal authorizations within 90 days of the date of issuance of the Commission staff's EA.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">There are two ways to become involved in the Commission's review of this project. First, any person wishing to obtain legal status by becoming a party to the proceedings for this project should, on or before the comment date stated below, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (<ref href="/us/cfr/t18/s385.214">18 CFR 385.214</ref> or 385.211) and the Regulations under the NGA (<ref href="/us/cfr/t18/s157.10">18 CFR 157.10</ref>). A person obtaining party status will be placed on the service list maintained by the Secretary of the Commission and will receive copies of all documents filed by the applicant and by all other parties. A party must submit five copies of filings made with the Commission and must mail a copy to the applicant and to every other party in the proceeding. Only parties to the proceeding can ask for court review of Commission orders in the proceeding.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">However, a person does not have to intervene in order to have comments considered. The second way to participate is by filing with the Secretary of the Commission, as soon as possible, an original and two copies of comments in support of or in opposition to this project. The Commission will consider these comments in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but the filing of a comment alone will not serve to make the filer a party to the proceeding. The Commission's rules require that persons filing comments in opposition to the project provide copies of their protests only to the party or parties directly involved in the protest.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Persons who wish to comment only on the environmental review of this project should submit an original and two copies of their comments to the Secretary of the Commission. Environmental commentors will be placed on the Commission's environmental mailing list, will receive copies of the environmental documents, and will be notified of meetings associated with the Commission's environmental review process. Environmental commentors will not be required to serve copies of filed documents on all other parties. However, the non-party commentors will not receive copies of all documents filed by other parties or issued by the Commission (except for the mailing of <?page num="26479"?>environmental documents issued by the Commission) and will not have the right to seek court review of the Commission's final order.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Commission strongly encourages electronic filings of comments, protests and interventions in lieu of paper using the “eFiling” link at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">http://www.ferc.gov.</inline> Persons unable to file electronically should submit an original and five copies of the protest or intervention to the Federal Energy regulatory Commission, 888 First Street NE., Washington, DC 20426.

The sole purpose of a preliminary permit, if issued, is to grant the permit holder priority to file a license application during the permit term. A preliminary permit does not authorize the permit holder to perform any land-disturbing activities or otherwise enter upon lands or waters owned by others without the owners' express permission.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed project would consist of the following: (1) A new upper reservoir with a surface area of 44 acres and a storage capacity of 660 acre-feet at a surface elevation of approximately 2,850 feet above mean sea level (msl) created through construction of a new roller-compacted concrete or rock-filled dam and/or dike; (2) excavating a new lower reservoir with a surface area of 30 acres and a total storage capacity of 792 acre-feet at a surface elevation of 2,200 feet msl; (3) a new 3,500-foot-long, 48-inch-diameter penstock connecting the upper and lower reservoirs; (4) a new 150-foot-long, 50-foot-wide powerhouse containing two turbine-generator units with a total rated capacity of 35 megawatts; (5) a new transmission line connecting the powerhouse to a nearby electric grid interconnection point at the Lookout Wind Farm; and (6) appurtenant facilities. Possible initial fill water and make-up water would come from the nearby Wills Creek, including groundwater. The proposed project would have an annual generation of 128,372 megawatt-hours.

</subject>

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for the Line QP, Line Q, and Queen Storage Project (Project), proposed by National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National Fuel) in the above-referenced docket. National Fuel requests authorization to construct and operate facilities in Forest and Warren Counties, Pennsylvania. National Fuel would abandon capacity by sale a natural gas storage system and associated pipeline that is no longer needed by the company and would provide that capacity to other gathering system suppliers in Pennsylvania. Additionally, National Fuel proposes to replace a compromised portion of the pipeline associated with the storage system and install new pipeline to maintain National Fuel's distribution capability.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of the Project in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The FERC staff concludes that approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The United States Army Corps of Engineers, United States Department of Agriculture-Forest Service (USDA–FS), and the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission participated as cooperating agencies in the preparation of the EA. Cooperating agencies have jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to resources potentially affected by the proposal and participate in the NEPA analysis. The USDA–FS may adopt and use the EA to consider the issuance of a special use permit for the portion of the project on USDA–FS lands.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Project includes the following facilities:
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• Abandon by sale the existing Queen Storage Field and Queen Compressor Station, property interests related thereto, and approximately 5.5 miles of the 6‐inch-diameter natural gas transmission pipeline (Line Q) from <?page num="26481"?>Queen Compressor Station to a point just south of the Allegheny River in Limestone Township, Warren County, Pennsylvania;
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• abandon in-place 0.18 mile of existing Line Q pipeline crossing the Allegheny River, with the exception of exposed portions that would be removed, and replace the crossing with a non-jurisdictional 12-inch-diameter natural gas transmission pipeline that would be sold to the future operator;
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• install approximately 5 miles of new 4‐inch-diameter natural gas transmission pipeline (Line QP) within the Line Q right‐of‐way; and
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">• construct a new regulator station and two service taps.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The FERC staff mailed copies of the EA to federal, state, and local government representatives and agencies; elected officials; environmental and public interest groups; Native American tribes; potentially affected landowners and other interested individuals and groups; and newspapers and libraries in the Project area. In addition, the EA is available for public viewing on the FERC's Web site (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">www.ferc.gov</inline>) using the eLibrary link. A limited number of copies of the EA are available for distribution and public inspection at: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Public Reference Room, 888 First Street NE., Room 2A, Washington, DC 20426, (202) 502–8371.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Any person wishing to comment on the EA may do so. Your comments should focus on the potential environmental effects, reasonable alternatives, and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impacts. The more specific your comments, the more useful they will be. To ensure that the Commission has the opportunity to consider your comments prior to making its decision on this project, it is important that we receive your comments in Washington, DC on or before <date date="2017-07-01">July 1, 2017</date>.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">For your convenience, there are three methods you can use to file your comments to the Commission.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Any person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures (<ref href="/us/cfr/t18/s385.214">18 CFR 385.214</ref>).<ref id="fnd2e8867" idref="fnd2e8873" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref> Only intervenors have the right to seek rehearing of the Commission's decision. The Commission grants affected landowners and others with environmental concerns intervenor status upon showing good cause by stating that they have a clear and direct interest in this proceeding which no other party can adequately represent. Simply filing environmental comments will not give you intervenor status, but you do not need intervenor status to have your comments considered.

FCC Form 601 is composed of a main form that contains administrative information and a series of schedules used for filing technical and other information. This form is used to apply for a new license, to amend or withdraw a pending application, to modify or renew an existing license, cancel a license, request a duplicate license, submit required notifications, request an extension of time to satisfy construction requirements, or request an administrative update to an existing license (such as mailing address change), request a Special Temporary Authority or Developmental License. Respondents are encouraged to submit FCC Form 601 electronically and are required to do so when submitting FCC Form 601 to apply for an authorization for which the applicant was the winning bidder in a spectrum auction.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The data collected on FCC Form 601 includes the FCC Registration Number (FRN), which serves as a “common link” for all filings an entity has with the FCC. The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 requires entities filing with the Commission use an FRN. On <date date="2016-07-14">July 14, 2016</date>, the Commission released a Report and Order in which it established the Upper Microwave Flexible Use Service authorizing mobile use in the 27.5–28.35 GHz, 37–38.6 GHz, and 38.6–40 GHz (39 GHz) bands, See Use of Spectrum Bands Above 24 GHz For Mobile Radio Services, et al., Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC 16–89, 31 FCC Rcd 8014 (2016). Of relevance to the information collection at issue here, the Commission established a process by which 39 GHz licensees can conduct a voluntary, pre-auction license swap or exchange which would give licensees the opportunity to consolidate their licensed blocks into larger tranches of contiguous spectrum thereby leaving more valuable empty contiguous channel blocks for the Commission to auction.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Commission seeks approval for revisions to its currently approved collection of information under OMB Control Number 3060–0798 to permit the collection of the additional information for Commission licenses and permits, pursuant to the information collection requirements adopted by the Commission in the Spectrum Frontiers R&amp;O, including the provisions authorizing voluntary channel swaps. We are proposing to revise schedule E of form 601 to allow licensees to file a modification to indicate active licenses and leases they are requesting authorization to swap. We do not anticipate that this revision will have any impact on the burden to complete the form. The Commission therefore seeks approval for a revision to its currently approved information collection on FCC Form 601 to revise FCC Form 601 accordingly.

</heading>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">I. Introduction
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Federal Trade Commission (“Commission”) has accepted, subject to final approval, an Agreement Containing Consent Order (“Consent Agreement”) with The Sherwin-Williams Company (“Sherwin-Williams”). The purpose of the Consent Agreement is to remedy the anticompetitive effects that would result from Sherwin-Williams's proposed acquisition of The Valspar Corporation (“Valspar”). Under the terms of the Consent Agreement, Sherwin-Williams must divest Valspar's North America Industrial Wood Coatings Business to Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. (“Axalta”) or another buyer approved by the Commission. The Consent Agreement provides the acquirer with the manufacturing plants and other tangible and intangible assets it needs to effectively compete in the market for the manufacture and sale of industrial wood coatings in North America. Sherwin-Williams must complete the divestiture within ten days of the closing of the acquisition.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2016-03-19">March 19, 2016</date>, Sherwin-Williams agreed to acquire Valspar for approximately $11.3 billion, including the assumption of debt. This acquisition would concentrate most of the nearly $1 billion North American industrial wood coatings industry in two major competitors—the combined Sherwin-Williams/Valspar and Akzo Nobel N.V. (“Akzo Nobel”). On <date date="2017-05-26">May 26, 2017</date>, the Commission issued an administrative complaint alleging that the acquisition, if consummated, may substantially lessen competition in the market for the manufacture and sale of industrial wood coatings in North America in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, <ref href="/us/usc/t15/s18">15 U.S.C. 18</ref>, and section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, <ref href="/us/usc/t15/s45">15 U.S.C. 45</ref>.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Consent Agreement has been placed on the public record for 30 days to solicit comments from interested persons. Comments received during this period will become a part of the public record. After 30 days, the Commission will review the Consent Agreement and comments received, and decide whether it should withdraw, modify, or make the Consent Agreement final.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">II. The Parties
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Sherwin-Williams, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, is one of the top three manufacturers of industrial wood coatings in North America. Sherwin-Williams supplies industrial wood coatings to a wide variety of customers, including manufacturers of kitchen cabinets, building products, and furniture (“wood products manufacturers”). Sherwin-Williams operates three dedicated industrial wood coatings plants in North America.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Valspar is one of the top three manufactuers of industrial wood coatings in North America. Like Sherwin-Williams, Valspar supplies industrial wood coatings to some of the largest wood product manufacturers. Valspar operates two dedicated industrial wood coatings plants located in North America.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">III. The Manufacture and Sale of Industrial Wood Coatings in North America
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Absent the remedy, Sherwin-Williams's acquisition would harm competition in the manufacture and sale of industrial wood coatings in North America. Industrial wood coatings consist of a broad category of stains, topcoats, and sealants used during the manufacture of wood products such as kitchen cabinets, furniture, and building products.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The relevant product market does not include off-the-shelf interior and exterior wood stains sold to retail consumers or other substrates such as laminates, decorative foils, films, or veneers. Industrial wood coatings are designed for application on high-speed manufacturing lines in a factory setting and are tailored to meet wood products manufacturers' specifications. These specifications are demanding; wood product manufacturers require industrial wood coatings that perform well along a variety of dimensions, such as resistance to abrasion and moisture. Wood coatings sold to retail consumers are not formulated to meet these specifications and are thus not economically viable substitutes. Since wood product manufacturers rely on finished wood for its appearance and to meet the demand and preferences of their own customers, they likewise cannot easily or quickly substitute other finishing materials or technologies for their finished wood products. Attempting to do so would result in a high risk of significant sales losses for these manufacturers.








 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">North America is the appropriate geographic market in which to evaluate the likely competitive effects of the proposed acquisition. Sherwin-Williams and Valspar sell industrial wood coatings to customers throughout North America. The relevant geographic market is no broader than North <?page num="26487"?>America because freight costs and logistical challenges limit wood product manufacturers' ability to purchase significant volumes of industrial wood coatings from overseas.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Currently, three firms—Sherwin-Williams, Valspar, and Akzo Nobel—manufacture and sell most industrial wood coatings in North America. Collectively, these three firms control over 70 percent of the North American market for industrial wood coatings. The Commission often calculates the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (“HHI”) to assess market concentration. Under the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice Horizontal Merger Guidelines, markets with an HHI above 2,500 are generally classified as “highly concentrated,” and acquisitions “resulting in highly concentrated markets that involve an increase in the HHI of more than 200 points will be presumed to be likely to enhance market power.” Absent the proposed remedy, the acquisition would increase the HHI by at least 900 points to over 2,700 for industrial wood coatings, resulting in a highly concentrated market.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">IV. Effects of the Acquisition
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Absent relief, the acquisition would combine two of the three leading industrial wood coatings suppliers and pose a significant risk of competitive harm. The industrial wood coatings industry is a mature, stable industry, with relatively low growth rates and high barriers to entry. The acquisition would eliminate substantial direct competition between Sherwin-Williams and Valspar. The acquisition also would increase the ease and likelihood of anticompetitive coordination between the only two remaining major suppliers. Thus, the acquisition likely would result in higher prices and a reduction in services and innovation to customers.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">V. Entry
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Entry into the market for the manufacture and sale of industrial wood coatings would not be timely, likely, or sufficient in magnitude, character, and scope to deter or counteract the likely competitive harm from the acquisition. The industrial wood coatings industry in North America enjoys significant barriers to entry and expansion including the high cost of building industrial wood coatings plants, the need for substantial technological and manufacturing expertise, and the significant on-site technical support requirements of large customers. For these reasons, entry by a new market participant or expansion by an existing one, would not deter the likely anticompetitive effects from the acquisition.
</p>
                                       <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">VI. The Consent Agreement
</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The proposed Consent Agreement remedies the competitive concerns raised by the acquisition by requiring Sherwin-Williams to divest Valspar's North America Industrial Wood Coatings Business to Axalta or another buyer approved by the Commission. In addition, the Consent Agreement requires Sherwin-Williams to transfer the customer contracts currently serviced by Valspar's Industrial Wood Coatings Business to the buyer.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under the proposed Consent Agreement, Sherwin-Williams will divest Valspar's industrial wood coatings plants located at High Point, North Carolina and Cornwall, Ontario. In addition, Sherwin-Williams will divest the research and development facilities, warehouses, and testing facilities of Valspar's Industrial Wood Coatings Business. Sherwin-Williams will also divest intellectual property, inventory, accounts receivable, government licenses and permits, and business records. The Consent Agreement limits Sherwin-Williams's use of, and access to, confidential business information pertaining to the divestiture assets.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Axalta is one of the leading suppliers of industrial coatings to large OEMs in the automotive and general industrial markets and is well positioned to operate these assets as an effective competitor. Through the proposed Consent Agreement, Axalta will become one of the leading North American manufacturers of industrial wood coatings. With the divested assets, Axalta will be able to replicate Valspar's position in the market today. It will own plants capable of manufacturing a broad range of industrial wood coatings as well as the other assets necessary to compete successfully in this market. Axalta's presence will preserve the three-way competition that currently exists in the relevant markets and moderate the potential for unilateral or coordinated effects.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Sherwin-Williams must complete the divestiture within ten days of the closing of the acquisition. A Monitor will monitor Sherwin-Williams' compliance with the obligations set forth in the Order. If Sherwin-Williams does not fully comply with the divestiture and requirements of the Order, the Commission may appoint a Divestiture Trustee to divest Valspar's North America Industrial Wood Coatings Business and perform Sherwin-Williams' other obligations consistent with the Order.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Consent Agreement, and is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the proposed Decision and Order or to modify its terms in any way.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&amp;C Act), as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) (<ref href="/us/pl/110/85">Pub. L. 110–85</ref>), requires the establishment of a Reportable Food Registry (the Registry) by which instances of reportable food must be submitted to FDA by responsible parties and may be submitted by public health officials. Section 417 of the FD&amp;C Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t21/s350f">21 U.S.C. 350f</ref>) defines “reportable food” as an “article of food (other than infant formula) for which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.” (Section 417(a)(2) of the FD&amp;C Act.) We believe that the most efficient and cost effective means to implement the Registry is by utilizing our electronic Safety Reporting Portal. The information collection provisions associated with the submission of reportable food reports has been approved under OMB control number 0910–0643.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In conjunction with the reportable foods requirements, section 417 of the FD&amp;C Act also establishes third party disclosure and recordkeeping burdens. Specifically, we may require the responsible party to notify the immediate previous source(s) and/or immediate subsequent recipient(s) of a reportable food (section 417(d)(6)(B)(i) to (ii) of the FD&amp;C Act). Similarly, we may also require the responsible party that is notified (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> the immediate <?page num="26491"?>previous source and/or immediate subsequent recipient) to notify their own immediate previous source(s) and/or immediate subsequent recipient(s) of a reportable food (section 417(d)(7)(C)(i) to (ii) of the FD&amp;C Act).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Notification to the immediate previous source(s) and immediate subsequent recipient(s) of the article of food may be accomplished by electronic communication methods such as email, fax, or text messaging or by telegrams, mailgrams, or first-class letters. Notification may also be accomplished by telephone call or other personal contacts but we recommend that such notifications also be confirmed by one of the previous methods and/or documented in an appropriate manner. We may require that the notification include any or all of the following data elements: (1) The date on which the article of food was determined to be a reportable food; (2) a description of the article of food including the quantity or amount; (3) the extent and nature of the adulteration; (4) the results of any investigation of the cause of the adulteration if it may have originated with the responsible party, if known; (5) the disposition of the article of food, when known; (6) product information typically found on packaging including product codes, use-by dates, and the names of manufacturers, packers, or distributors sufficient to identify the article of food; (7) contact information for the responsible party; (8) contact information for parties directly linked in the supply chain and notified under section 417(d)(6)(B) or 417(d)(7)(C) of the FD&amp;C Act, as applicable; (9) the information required by FDA to be included in the notification provided by the responsible party involved under section 417(d)(6)(B) or 417(d)(7)(C) of the FD&amp;C Act or required to report under section 417(d)(7)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act; and (10) the unique number described in section 417(d)(4) of the FD&amp;C Act (section 417(d)(6)(B)(iii)(I), (d)(7)(C)(iii)(I), and (e) of the FD&amp;C Act). We may also require that the notification provides information about the actions that the recipient of the notification will perform and/or any other information we may require (section 417(d)(6)(B)(iii)(II) and (III), (d)(7)(C)(iii)(II) and (III) of the FD&amp;C Act).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Section 417(g) of the FD&amp;C Act requires that responsible persons maintain records related to reportable foods for a period of 2 years.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The congressionally identified purpose of the Registry is to provide “a reliable mechanism to track patterns of adulteration in food [which] would support efforts by the Food and Drug Administration to target limited inspection resources to protect the public health” (FDAAA, section 1005(a)(4)). The reporting and recordkeeping requirements described previously are designed to enable FDA to quickly identify and track an article of food (other than infant formula) for which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to such article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. We use the information collected under these regulations to help ensure that such products are quickly and efficiently removed from the market.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As required under section 1005(f) of FDAAA and to assist industry, we have issued the guidance document entitled, “Questions and Answers Regarding the Reportable Food Registry as Established by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007,” which is available at <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/ucm180761.htm.</inline> The guidance contains questions and answers relating to the requirements under section 417 of the FD&amp;C Act, including: (1) How, when and where to submit reports to FDA; (2) who is required to submit reports to FDA; (3) what is required to be submitted to FDA; and (4) what may be required when providing notifications to other persons in the supply chain of an article of food. The guidance also refers to previously approved collections of information found in FDA regulations. The collections of information in questions 20 and 21 of the guidance have been approved under OMB control number 0910–0249.

Based on past FDA experiences, we estimate that we could receive 200 to 1,200 “reportable” food <?page num="26492"?>reports annually from 200 to 1,200 mandatory and voluntary users of the electronic reporting system. We utilized the upper-bound estimate of 1,200 for these calculations.

We also estimate that it will take 0.6 hours for the immediate previous source and/or the immediate subsequent recipient to also notify their immediate previous source(s) and/or immediate subsequent recipient(s). The Agency bases its estimate on its experience with mandatory and voluntary reports submitted to FDA.

This notification burden will not affect voluntary reporters of reportable food events. Therefore, we estimate that the total burden of notifying the immediate previous source(s) and immediate subsequent recipient(s) under section 417(d)(6)(B)(i) and (ii), (d)(7)(C)(i) and (ii) of the FD&amp;C Act for 1,200 reportable foods will be 2,880 hours annually (1,200 × 0.6 hours) + (1,200 × 0.6 hours) + (1,200 × 0.6 hours) + (1,200 × 0.6 hours). This annual burden is shown in table 1.

Based on past FDA experiences, we estimate that each mandatory report and its associated notifications will require 30 minutes of recordkeeping for the 2-year period, or 15 minutes per record per year. The annual recordkeeping burden for mandatory reportable food reports and their associated notifications is thus estimated to be 300 hours (1,200 × 0.25 hours).
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">We do not expect that records will always be kept in relation to voluntary reportable food reports. Therefore, we estimate that records will be kept for four voluntary reports we expect to receive annually. The recordkeeping burden associated with voluntary reports is thus estimated to be 1 hour annually (4 × 0.25 hours). The estimated total annual recordkeeping burden will be 301 hours annually (1,200 × 0.25 hours) + (4 × 0.25 hours). This annual burden is shown in table 2.

Participation in the surveys is voluntary. This request covers customer/partner service surveys of regulated entities, such as food processors; cosmetic drug, biologic and medical device manufacturers; consumers; and health professionals.

RWHAP, authorized under Title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009, awards funding to recipients to provide efficient and effective health care and support services, with an emphasis on providing life-saving and life-extending services for people living with HIV across the country. HRSA is streamlining the data collection forms by making the following changes:

Accurate records of the providers receiving Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funding, the clients served, and services provided continue to be critical for the implementation of the statute.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The RSR provides data on the characteristics of RWHAP-funded grant recipients, their contracted service providers, and the clients served. The RSR is intended to support clinical quality management, performance measurement, service delivery, and client monitoring at the systems and client levels. The reporting system consists of two online data forms, the Recipient Report and the Service Provider Report, as well as a data file containing the client-level data elements. Data are submitted annually. The statute specifies the importance of grant recipient accountability and linking performance to the budget. The RSR is used to ensure compliance with the statute, evaluate the progress of programs, monitor grant recipient and provider performance, and inform annual reports to Congress.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Information collected through the RSR is critical for HRSA, state, city, and local grant recipients, and individual providers to assess the status of existing HIV-related service delivery systems, investigate trends in service utilization, and health outcomes. Minor revisions to the RSR are being made to streamline data collection and reduce reporting burden.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The removal of variable ID 8, “Self-Reported Transgender Status”, will streamline reporting of client demographic data. With the additional response options for variable ID 7, “Self-Reported Gender”—“Transgender Male to Female”, “Transgender Female to Male”, and “Transgender Other”, HRSA will improve the overall quality of demographic data that are reported, which is essential for program monitoring. The additions and deletions of response options for variable IDs 19 and 35, as well as the renaming of variable IDs 47, 48, and 74, will allow HRSA to align its data collection efforts with recent program policy notices (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">e.g.</inline> Policy Clarification Notice 16–02, Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Services: Eligible Individuals and Allowable Uses of Funds) that incorporate both HHS regulations and program specific requirements set forth in the RWHAP statute.

The Show Cause Order proposed the revocation of Registrant's Certificates of Registration, the denial of any applications to renew or modify his registration, and the denial of any applications for any other DEA registration on the ground that he lacks “state authority to handle controlled substances” in Mississippi, the State in which he is registered with the DEA. Order to Show Cause, at 1–2 (citing <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s824/a/3">21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3)</ref>).
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">With respect to the Agency's jurisdiction, the Show Cause Order alleged that Registrant is registered as a practitioner in schedules II through V, pursuant to Certificate of Registration FE2565779, at the address of 409 Tyler Holmes Drive, Winona, Mississippi. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at 1. The Order alleged that Registrant is also registered as a practitioner in schedules II through V, pursuant to Certificate of Registration No. FE2882226, at the address of 140 Burke-Calhoun City Road, Calhoun City, Mississippi. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> The Order also alleged that Registrant is registered as a practitioner in schedules II through V, pursuant to Certificate of Registration No. FE2882062, at the address of 1100 Hwy 16 E, Carthage, Mississippi. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> The Show Cause Order alleges that all three of these registrations expire on <date date="2017-08-31">August 31, 2017</date>. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline>

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">As substantive grounds for the proceeding, the Show Cause Order alleged that on <date date="2016-03-03">March 3, 2016</date>, the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure issued an “Order of Prohibition, prohibiting [Registrant] from practicing medicine,” that the status of Registrant's “Mississippi medical license is `expired,'” and that he is “currently without authority to practice medicine or handle controlled substances in the State of Mississippi, the [S]tate in which [he is] registered with the DEA.” <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at 2. Thus, based on his “lack of authority to [dispense] controlled substances in . . .

</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Show Cause Order notified Registrant of his right to request a hearing on the allegations or to submit a written statement in lieu of a hearing, the procedure for electing either option, and the consequence for failing to elect either option. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> (citing <ref href="/us/cfr/t21/s1301.43">21 CFR 1301.43</ref>). The Show Cause Order also notified Registrant of his right to submit a corrective action plan. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at 2–3.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Government states that on <date date="2016-12-30">December 30, 2016</date>, “[p]ersonnel” from the Jackson District Office of the New Orleans Field Division personally served the Order to Show Cause on Registrant. Government Request for Final Agency Action (RFFA), at 1–2 (citing Exhibit (GX) 4). Registrant signed a Form DEA–12, Receipt for Cash or Other Items, documenting service of the Order on him. GX 4 (stating “OTSC Documents” for the “Description of Items”).
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2017-03-14">March 14, 2017</date>, the Government forwarded its Request for Final Agency Action and an evidentiary record to my Office. Therein, the Government represents that Registrant has neither requested a hearing nor “otherwise corresponded or communicated with DEA regarding” the Show Cause Order. RFFA, at 2. Based on the Government's representation and the record, I find that more than 30 days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was served on Registrant, and he has neither requested a hearing nor submitted a written statement in lieu of a hearing. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at 2 (citing <ref href="/us/cfr/t21/s1301.43/d">21 CFR 1301.43(d)</ref>). Accordingly, I find that Registrant has waived his right to a hearing or to submit a written statement and issue this Decision and Order based on relevant evidence submitted by the Government. I make the following findings.
</p>
                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Findings of Fact
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Registrant is a physician who held Mississippi Medical License No. 15463 until it expired on <date date="2016-03-03">March 3, 2016</date>. GX 5. In addition, the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure issued an Order of Prohibition to Registrant on <date date="2016-03-03">March 3, 2016</date>. GX 3 at 4. Under the Order, Registrant was “immediately prohibited from practicing medicine” until he undergoes a complete evaluation for impairment at an approved treatment facility “and thereafter is found capable of returning to the practice of medicine by the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure.” <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> Registrant has offered no evidence that such a finding has been made, nor that he otherwise currently has authority to practice medicine or dispense controlled substances under the laws of Mississippi. Based on the above, I find that Registrant does not currently have authority under the laws of Mississippi to dispense controlled substances.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Registrant is the holder of three DEA Certificates of Registration, pursuant to which he is authorized to dispense controlled substances in schedules II through V as a practitioner. Pursuant to Registration No. FE2565779, Registrant is authorized to dispense controlled substances at the address of 409 Tyler Holmes Drive, Winona, Mississippi. GX 1 at 1. Pursuant to Registration No. FE2882226, Registrant is authorized to dispense controlled substances at the address of 140 Burke-Calhoun City Road, Calhoun City, Mississippi. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at 5.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Pursuant to <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s824/a/3">21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3)</ref>, the Attorney General is authorized to suspend or revoke a registration issued under section 823 of Title 21, “upon a finding that the registrant . . . has had [his] State license . . . suspended [or] revoked . . . by competent State authority and is no longer authorized by State law to engage in the . . . dispensing of controlled substances.” With respect to a practitioner, DEA has long held that the possession of authority to dispense controlled substances under the laws of the State in which a practitioner engages in professional practice is a fundamental condition for obtaining and maintaining a registration. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See, e.g., James L. Hooper,</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/76/71371">76 FR 71371</ref> (2011), <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">pet. for rev. denied,</inline> 481 Fed.

</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This rule derives from the text of two provisions of the CSA. First, Congress defined “the term `practitioner' [to] mean[ ] a . . . physician . . . or other person licensed, registered or otherwise permitted, by . . . the jurisdiction in which he practices . . . to distribute, dispense, [or] administer . . . a controlled substance in the course of professional practice.” <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s802/21">21 U.S.C. 802(21)</ref>. Second, in setting the requirements for obtaining a practitioner's registration, Congress directed that “[t]he Attorney General shall register practitioners . . . if the applicant is authorized to dispense . . . controlled substances under the laws of the State in which [s]he practices.” 21 <?page num="26516"?>U.S.C. 823(f). Because Congress has clearly mandated that a practitioner possess state authority in order to be deemed a practitioner under the Act, DEA has held repeatedly that revocation of a practitioner's registration is the appropriate sanction whenever he is no longer authorized to dispense controlled substances under the laws of the State in which he engages in professional practice. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See, e.g., Calvin Ramsey,</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/76/20034">76 FR 20034</ref>, 20036 (2011); <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Sheran Arden Yeates, M.D.,</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/71/39130">71 FR 39130</ref>, 39131 (2006); <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Dominick A.

</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Moreover, because “the controlling question” in a proceeding brought under <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s824/a/3">21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3)</ref> is whether the holder of a practitioner's registration “is currently authorized to handle controlled substances in the [S]tate,” <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Hooper,</inline> 76 FR at 71371 (quoting <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Anne Lazar Thorn,</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/62/12847">62 FR 12847</ref>, 12848 (1997)), the Agency has also long held that revocation is warranted even where a practitioner has lost his state authority by virtue of the State's use of summary process and the State has yet to provide a hearing to challenge the suspension. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Bourne Pharmacy,</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/72/18273">72 FR 18273</ref>, 18274 (2007); <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Wingfield Drugs,</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/52/27070">52 FR 27070</ref>, 27071 (1987). Thus, it is of no consequence that the Mississippi Board has employed summary process in suspending Registrant's state license. What is consequential is that Registrant is no longer currently authorized to dispense controlled substances in the State in which he is registered. I will therefore order that his registrations be revoked.

Nwaokocha, M.D. (Respondent), of Harwood Heights, Illinois. The Show Cause Order proposed the revocation of Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration No. FN5571864 on the ground that he “do[es] not have authority to handle controlled substances in the State of Illinois, the [S]tate in which [he is] registered with the DEA.” Order to Show Cause, at 1 (citing <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s823/f">21 U.S.C. 823(f)</ref> and 824(a)(3)).
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">With respect to the Agency's jurisdiction, the Show Cause Order alleged that Respondent is the holder of Certificate of Registration No. FN5571864, pursuant to which he is authorized to dispense controlled substances as a practitioner in schedules II through V, at the registered address of 4740 N. Harlem Ave., Harwood Heights, Illinois. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> The Order also alleged that this registration does not expire until <date date="2018-10-31">October 31, 2018</date>. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline>

</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Show Cause Order notified Respondent of (1) his right to request a hearing on the allegations or to submit a written statement in lieu of a hearing, (2) the procedure for electing either option, and (3) the consequence for failing to elect either option. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> (citing <ref href="/us/cfr/t21/s1301.43">21 CFR 1301.43</ref>). The Show Cause Order also notified Respondent of his right to submit a corrective action plan. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at 2–3.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2016-12-13">December 13, 2016</date>, a Diversion Investigator from the Chicago Field Division personally handed a copy of the Order to Show Cause to the Respondent at his residence located at 9453 Lorel Ave., Skokie, Illinois 60077. Government's Submission of Evidence and Request for Summary Disposition (hereinafter, Govt. Mot.), Exhibit (hereinafter, GX) 1, at 1. Following service of the Show Cause Order, Respondent requested a hearing on the allegations. The matter was placed on the docket of the Office of Administrative Law Judges and assigned to Chief Administrative Law Judge John J. Mulrooney, II (hereinafter, CALJ). On <date date="2017-01-04">January 4, 2017</date>, the CALJ ordered the Government to submit evidence to <?page num="26517"?>support the allegation, and any motion for summary disposition, no later than <date date="2017-01-17">January 17, 2017</date>. Order Directing the Filing of Government Evidence or Lack of State Authority Allegation and Briefing Schedule, at 1. The CALJ also directed Respondent to file his response to any summary disposition motion no later than <date date="2017-01-27">January 27, 2017</date>. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline>

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2017-01-13">January 13, 2017</date>, the Government filed its Request for Summary Disposition. In its Request, the Government argued that it is undisputed that Respondent lacks authority to handle controlled substances in Illinois because the IDFPR indefinitely suspended Respondent's medical license. Govt. Mot. at 2. The Government further argued “that the possession of authority to dispense controlled substances under the laws of the State in which a practitioner engages in professional practice is a fundamental condition for both obtaining and maintaining a practitioner's registration,” and that under the DEA's precedents, revocation is warranted even where a State has invoked summary process to suspend a practitioner's state authority and has yet to provide the practitioner with a hearing where he may prevail. Govt. Mot., at 4–5 (citations omitted). As support for its summary disposition request, the Government attached, <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">inter alia,</inline> a copy of the IDFPR's <date date="2016-03-15">March 15, 2016</date> Order placing an “INDEFINITE SUSPENSION” on Respondent's Illinois Physician and Surgeon license, a letter from the Acting Director of the IDFPR confirming that the indefinite suspension “remains in effect as of <date date="2017-01-10">January 10, 2017</date>,” and a <date date="2017-01-12">January 12, 2017</date> printout from the IDFPR's Web site showing that his license status was “SUSPENDED.” <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at GX 1, Attachments D–F.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In his responsive pleading, Respondent did not dispute that his medical license had been suspended by the State of Illinois, and that “[t]he order of suspension is in effect.” Respondent's Response to Government's Request for Summary Disposition (hereinafter, Resp. Reply), at 2. Instead, he argued that he “anticipated” that his motion to stay the suspension pending his appeal of the IDFPR's suspension order would be decided on <date date="2017-02-14">February 14, 2017</date>, and that an order granting such motion would enable him to resume practicing medicine. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> He further argued that there was a “likelihood” that his stay motion would be granted by the Illinois Circuit Court because a stay motion had been granted in a prior appeal. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> Respondent also argued that the CALJ should delay ruling because, in Respondent's view, DEA was enforcing a “discretionary” ground for denying his revocation pursuant to <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s824/a/3">21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3)</ref>, not a mandatory ground. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at 3. Lastly, Respondent argued that Due Process required the CALJ to give Respondent “an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time,” and that a “meaningful time” was after the Illinois Circuit Court had ruled. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at 3–4. As a result, Respondent requested that the CALJ deny or stay the Government's Request for Summary Disposition “pending a decision by the Circuit Court.” <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at 4.



 </p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">On <date date="2017-01-30">January 30, 2017</date>, the Government filed its opposition to Respondent's request for a stay with the CALJ. The Government noted that a practitioner's expectation of obtaining state authority in a concurrent legal proceeding is not a basis to stay revocation proceedings against a practitioner who lacks such authority because the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) requires practitioners to hold state authority in order to be registered. Government's Opposition to Dr. Nwaokocha's Request for a Stay at 2–3. In the same vein, the Government contended that, when a practitioner's state license is suspended, then revocation of that practitioner's DEA registration is mandatory. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at 3–4 (citing <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s802/21">21 U.S.C. 802(21)</ref> and 821(f) [sic]).
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The CALJ rejected Respondent's request for a stay, noting that “revocation is warranted even where a practitioner's state authority has been summarily suspended and the State has yet to provide the practitioner with a hearing to challenge the State's action and at which he . . . may ultimately prevail.” Order Denying the Respondent's Request for Stay; Granting the Government's Motion for Summary Disposition; and Recommended Rulings, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision of the Administrative Law Judge (R.D.) at 3 (citing <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s802/21">21 U.S.C. 802(21)</ref> and 823(f) (quotations and citations omitted)). While he was “not unmindful of the Respondent's arguments concerning the Agency's expenditure of resources should his state authority be reinstated on <date date="2017-02-14">February 14, 2017</date>,” the CALJ noted that the DEA has previously held “that a stay in administrative enforcement proceedings is `unlikely to ever be justified' due to ancillary proceedings involving the Respondent.” <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> at 4 (quoting <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Grider Drug #1 &amp; Grider Drug #2,</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/77/44070">77 FR 44070</ref>, 44104 n.97 (2012)).<ref id="fnd2e14181" idref="fnd2e14187" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">1</ref>

Having reviewed the record, I adopt the CALJ's finding that by virtue of the IDFPR's Order, Respondent is currently without authority to handle controlled substances in Illinois, the State in which he holds his registration with the Agency, and is thus not entitled to maintain his registration. I further adopt the CALJ's recommendation that I revoke his registration and deny any pending application. I make the following factual findings.
</p>
                                 <heading style="-uslm-sgm:HD1">Findings of Fact
</heading>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Respondent is a physician who holds Illinois Medical License No. 036067760. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See</inline> GX 1, Attachment E, at 1. However, on <date date="2016-03-15">March 15, 2016</date>, the IDFPR issued an Order indefinitely suspending Respondent's medical license. GX 1, Attachment D, at 8. The Panel further ordered that the suspension be “implemented as of the date of the Order.” <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Id.</inline> 9. Respondent offered no evidence in his Response to the Government's Request or at any time thereafter showing that the IDFPR has lifted the suspension. Based on the above, I find that Respondent does not currently have authority under the laws of Illinois to dispense controlled substances.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Respondent is also the holder of DEA Certificate of Registration No. FN5571864, pursuant to which he is authorized to dispense controlled substances in schedules II through V as a practitioner, at the address of 4740 N.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Pursuant to <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s824/a/3">21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3)</ref>, the Attorney General is authorized to suspend or revoke a registration issued under section 823 of the CSA, “upon a finding that the registrant . . . has had his State license . . . suspended [or] revoked . . . by competent State authority and is no longer authorized by State law to engage in the . . . dispensing of controlled substances.” Also, DEA has long held that the possession of authority to dispense controlled substances under the laws of the State in which a practitioner engages in professional practice is a fundamental condition for obtaining and maintaining a practitioner's registration. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">See, e.g., James L.

</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">This rule derives from the text of two provisions of the CSA. First, Congress defined “the term `practitioner' [to] mean[] a . . . physician . . . or other person licensed, registered or otherwise permitted, by . . . the jurisdiction in which he practices . . . to distribute, dispense, [or] administer . . . a controlled substance in the course of professional practice.” <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s802/21">21 U.S.C. 802(21)</ref>. Second, in setting the requirements for obtaining a practitioner's registration, Congress directed that “[t]he Attorney General shall register practitioners . . . if the applicant is authorized to dispense . . . controlled substances under the laws of the State in which he practices.” <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s823/f">21 U.S.C. 823(f)</ref>.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Moreover, because “the controlling question” in a proceeding brought under <ref href="/us/usc/t21/s824/a/3">21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3)</ref> is whether the holder of a DEA registration “is currently authorized to handle controlled substances in the [S]tate,” <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Hooper,</inline> 76 FR at 71371 (quoting <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Anne Lazar Thorn,</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/62/12847">62 FR 12847</ref>, 12848 (1997)), the Agency has also long held that revocation is warranted even where a practitioner has lost his state authority by virtue of the State's use of summary process and the State has yet to provide a hearing to challenge the suspension. <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Bourne Pharmacy,</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/72/18273">72 FR 18273</ref>, 18274 (2007); <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Wingfield Drugs,</inline> <ref href="/us/fr/52/27070">52 FR 27070</ref>, 27071 (1987).

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration seeks to collect information from members of the public to plan, conduct, and register participants and volunteers for the NASA Human Exploration Rover Challenge, which supports science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) education. This engineering design challenge focuses on NASA's current plans to explore planets, moons, asteroids, and comets—all members of the solar system family. The challenge will focus on designing, constructing and testing technologies for mobility devices to perform in these different environments, and it will provide valuable experiences that engage students in the technologies and concepts that will be needed in future exploration missions. NASA collects the minimum information necessary from teams, participants, and volunteers to plan and conduct the event.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is granting an exemption to allow a departure from the certification information of Tier 1 of the generic design control document (DCD) and is issuing License Amendment No. 61 to Combined Licenses (COL), NPF–93 and NPF–94, respectively. The COLs were issued to South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Company and the South Carolina Public Service Authority, (both collectively referred to as the licensee) for construction and operation of the Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) Units 2 and 3, located in Fairfield County, South Carolina.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The granting of the exemption allows the changes to Tier 1 information asked for in the amendment. Because the acceptability of the exemption was determined in part by the acceptability of the amendment, the exemption and amendment are being issued concurrently.

</heading>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The NRC is granting an exemption from paragraph B of section III, “Scope and Contents,” of appendix D, “Design Certification Rule for the AP1000,” to part 52 of title 10 of the <inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">Code of Federal Regulations</inline> (10 CFR), and issuing License Amendment No. 61 to COLs, NPF–93 and NPF–94, to the licensee. The exemption is required by Paragraph A.4 of Section VIII, “Processes for Changes and Departures,” of appendix D, to <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/p52">10 CFR part 52</ref> to allow the licensee to depart from Tier 1 information. The amendment authorizes changes to the VCSNS Units 2 and 3 Updated Final Safety Analysis Report in the form of departures from the incorporated plant specific DCD Tier 2 information, proposes to depart from involved plant-specific Tier 1 information (and associated COL Appendix C information) and from involved plant-specific Technical Specifications as incorporated in Appendix A of the COL. With the requested amendment, the licensee proposed changes to reflect an increase in the efficiency of the return of condensate utilized by the passive core cooling system to the in-containment refueling water storage tank to support the capability for long-term cooling.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Part of the justification for granting the exemption was provided by the review of the amendment. Because the exemption is necessary in order to issue the requested license amendment, the NRC granted the exemption and issued the amendment concurrently, rather than in sequence. This included issuing a combined safety evaluation containing the NRC staff's review of both the exemption request and the license amendment. The exemption met all applicable regulatory criteria set forth in <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s50.12">10 CFR 50.12</ref>, <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s52.7">10 CFR 52.7</ref>, and Section VIII.A.4 of appendix D to <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/p52">10 CFR part 52</ref>. The license amendment was found to be acceptable as well. The combined safety evaluation is available in ADAMS under Accession No. ML17026A479.






 </p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Identical exemption documents (except for referenced unit numbers and license numbers) were issued to the licensee for VCSNS Units 2 and 3 (COLs NPF–93 and NPF–94). The exemption documents for VCSNS Units 2 and 3 can be found in ADAMS under Accession Nos. ML17026A400 and ML17026A410, respectively. The exemption is reproduced (with the exception of abbreviated titles and additional citations) in Section II of this document. The amendment documents for COLs NPF–93 and NPF–94 are available in ADAMS under Accession Nos. ML17026A391 and ML17026A398, respectively. A summary of the amendment documents is provided in Section III of this document.

It makes reference to the combined safety evaluation that provides the reasoning for the findings made by the NRC (and listed under Item 1) in order to grant the exemption:

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">A. The exemption is authorized by law;
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">B. the exemption presents no undue risk to public health and safety;
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">C. the exemption is consistent with the common defense and security;

</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">E. the special circumstances outweigh any decrease in safety that may result from the reduction in standardization caused by the exemption; and

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">F. the exemption will not result in a significant decrease in the level of safety otherwise provided by the design.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">2.

This exemption is related to, and necessary for the granting of License Amendment No. 61, which is being issued concurrently with this exemption.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">3. As explained in Section 5.0 of the NRC staff's Safety Evaluation (ADAMS Accession No. ML17026A479), this exemption meets the eligibility criteria for categorical exclusion set forth in <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s51.22/c/9">10 CFR 51.22(c)(9)</ref>. Therefore, pursuant to <ref href="/us/cfr/t10/s51.22/b">10 CFR 51.22(b)</ref>, no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment needs to be prepared in connection with the issuance of the exemption.

Paragraph (a)(i) of Proposed Rule 6.97 states that, for purposes of Rule 6.97, the terms “CAT NMS Plan”, “Industry Member”, “Operating Committee”, and “Participant” are defined as set forth in the Rule 6.85 (Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) Compliance Rule—Definitions), and the term “CAT Fee” is defined as set forth in the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT)—Funding Fees. In addition, the Exchange proposes to add paragraph (a)(ii) to Proposed Rule 6.97. New paragraph (a)(ii) would define the term “Subcommittee” to mean a subcommittee designated by the Operating Committee pursuant to the CAT NMS Plan. This definition is the same substantive definition as set forth in Section 1.1 of the CAT NMS Plan.

Section 11.5 of the CAT NMS Plan also states that decisions by the Operating Committee or Subcommittee on such matters shall be binding on Industry Members, without prejudice to the right of any Industry Member to seek redress from the SEC pursuant to SEC Rule 608 or in any other appropriate forum. The Exchange proposes to adopt paragraph (b) of Proposed Rule 6.97. Paragraph (b) of Proposed Rule 6.97 states that disputes initiated by an Industry Member with respect to CAT Fees charged to such Industry Member pursuant to the Consolidated Audit Trail Funding Fees, including disputes related to the designated tier and the fee calculated pursuant to such tier, shall be resolved by the Operating Committee, or a Subcommittee designated by the Operating Committee, of the CAT NMS Plan, pursuant to the Fee Dispute Resolution Procedures adopted pursuant to the CAT NMS Plan and set forth in paragraph (c) of Proposed Rule 6.97.

Specifically, the Fee Dispute Resolution Procedures provide the procedure for Industry Members that dispute CAT Fees charged to such Industry Member pursuant to one or more of the Participants' Consolidated Audit Trail Funding Fees Rules, including disputes related to the designated tier and the fee calculated pursuant to such tier, to apply for an opportunity to be heard and to have the CAT Fees charged to such Industry Member reviewed.

Any objection to a decision not specified in writing will be considered to have been abandoned and may be disregarded.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Procedures state that a final decision regarding the disputed CAT Fees by the Operating Committee, or the Fee Review Subcommittee (if there is no review by the Operating Committee), must be provided within 90 days of the date on which the Industry Member filed a written application regarding disputed CAT Fees with the Company. The Operating Committee may extend the 90-day time limit at its discretion.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, the Procedures state that any notices or other documents may be served upon the applicant either personally or by leaving the same at its, his or her place of business or by deposit in the United States post office, postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, addressed to the <?page num="26525"?>applicant at its, his or her last known business or residence address. The Procedures also state that any time limits imposed under the Procedures for the submission of answers, petitions or other materials may be extended by permission of the Operating Committee. All papers and documents relating to review by the Fee Review Subcommittee or the Operating Committee must be submitted to the Fee Review Subcommittee or Operating Committee, as applicable.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Procedures also note that decisions on such CAT Fee disputes made pursuant to these Procedures will be binding on Industry Members, without prejudice to the rights of any such Industry Member to seek redress from the SEC or in any other appropriate forum.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Finally, an Industry Member that files a written application with the Company regarding disputed CAT Fees in accordance with these Procedures is not required to pay such disputed CAT Fees until the dispute is resolved in accordance with these Procedures, including any review by the SEC or in any other appropriate forum. For these purposes, the disputed CAT Fees means the amount of the invoiced CAT Fees that the Industry Member has asserted pursuant to these Procedures that such Industry Member does not owe to the Company. The Industry Member must pay any invoiced CAT Fees that are not disputed CAT Fees when due as set forth in the original invoice.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Once the dispute regarding CAT Fees is resolved pursuant to these Procedures, if it is determined that the Industry Member owes any of the disputed CAT Fees, then the Industry Member must pay such disputed CAT Fees that are owed as well as interest on such disputed CAT Fees from the original due date (that is, 30 days after receipt of the original invoice of such CAT Fees) until such disputed CAT Fees are paid at a per annum rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Prime Rate plus 300 basis points, or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange notes that the proposed rule change implements Section 11.5 of the CAT NMS Plan approved by the Commission, and is designed to assist the Exchange in meeting its regulatory obligations pursuant to the Plan. Similarly, all national securities exchanges and FINRA are proposing this proposed rule to implement the requirements of the CAT NMS Plan. Therefore, this is not a competitive rule filing and, therefore, it does not raise competition issues between and among the exchanges and FINRA.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Fee Review Subcommittee will determine all questions concerning the admissibility of evidence and will otherwise regulate the conduct of the hearing. Each of the parties will be permitted to make an opening statement, present witnesses and documentary evidence, cross examine opposing witnesses and present closing arguments orally or in writing as determined by the Fee Review Subcommittee. The Fee Review Subcommittee also will have the right to question all parties and witnesses to the proceeding. The Fee Review Subcommittee must keep a record of the hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Fee Review Subcommittee must set forth its decision in writing and send the written decision to the parties to the proceeding. Such decisions will contain the reasons supporting the conclusions of the Fee Review Subcommittee.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The decision of the Fee Review Subcommittee will be subject to review by the Operating Committee either on its own motion within 20 business days after issuance of the decision or upon written request submitted by the applicant within 15 business days after issuance of the decision. The applicant's petition must be in writing and must specify the findings and conclusions to which the applicant objects, together with the reasons for such objections. Any objection to a decision not specified in writing will be considered to have been abandoned and may be disregarded. Parties may petition to submit a written argument to the Operating Committee and may request an opportunity to make an oral argument before the Operating Committee. The Operating Committee will have sole discretion to grant or deny either request.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Operating Committee will conduct the review. The review will be made upon the record and will be made after such further proceedings, if any, as the Operating Committee may order. Based upon such record, the Operating Committee may affirm, reverse or modify, in whole or in part, the decision of the Fee Review Subcommittee. The decision of the Operating Committee will be in writing, will be sent to the parties to the proceeding and will be final.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Procedures state that a final decision regarding the disputed CAT Fees by the Operating Committee, or the <?page num="26528"?>Fee Review Subcommittee (if there is no review by the Operating Committee), must be provided within 90 days of the date on which the Industry Member filed a written application regarding disputed CAT Fees with the Company. The Operating Committee may extend the 90-day time limit at its discretion.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, the Procedures state that any notices or other documents may be served upon the applicant either personally or by leaving the same at its, his or her place of business or by deposit in the United States post office, postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, addressed to the applicant at its, his or her last known business or residence address. The Procedures also state that any time limits imposed under the Procedures for the submission of answers, petitions or other materials may be extended by permission of the Operating Committee. All papers and documents relating to review by the Fee Review Subcommittee or the Operating Committee must be submitted to the Fee Review Subcommittee or Operating Committee, as applicable.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Procedures also note that decisions on such CAT Fee disputes made pursuant to these Procedures will be binding on Industry Members, without prejudice to the rights of any such Industry Member to seek redress from the SEC or in any other appropriate forum.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Finally, an Industry Member that files a written application with the Company regarding disputed CAT Fees in accordance with these Procedures is not required to pay such disputed CAT Fees until the dispute is resolved in accordance with these Procedures, including any review by the SEC or in any other appropriate forum. For these purposes, the disputed CAT Fees means the amount of the invoiced CAT Fees that the Industry Member has asserted pursuant to these Procedures that such Industry Member does not owe to the Company. The Industry Member must pay any invoiced CAT Fees that are not disputed CAT Fees when due as set forth in the original invoice.








 



</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Once the dispute regarding CAT Fees is resolved pursuant to these Procedures, if it is determined that the Industry Member owes any of the disputed CAT Fees, then the Industry Member must pay such disputed CAT Fees that are owed as well as interest on such disputed CAT Fees from the original due date (that is, 30 days after receipt of the original invoice of such CAT Fees) until such disputed CAT Fees are paid at a per annum rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Prime Rate plus 300 basis points, or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

The Exchange notes that the proposed rule change implements section 11.5 of the CAT NMS Plan approved by the Commission, and is designed to assist the Exchange in meeting its regulatory obligations pursuant to the Plan. Similarly, all national securities exchanges and FINRA are proposing this proposed rule to implement the requirements of the CAT NMS Plan. Therefore, this is not a competitive rule filing, and, therefore, it does not raise competition issues between and among the exchanges and FINRA.

Paragraph (a)(1) of Proposed Rule 4.17 states that, for purposes of Rule 4.17, the terms “CAT NMS Plan”, “Industry Member”, “Operating Committee”, and “Participant” are defined as set forth in the Rule 4.5 (Consolidated Audit Trail—Definitions), and the term “CAT Fee” is defined as set forth in the Consolidated Audit Trail Funding Fees. In addition, the Exchange proposes to add paragraph (a)(2) to Proposed Rule 4.17.

The Exchange proposes to adopt paragraph (b) of Proposed Rule 4.17. Paragraph (b) of Proposed Rule 4.17 states that disputes initiated by an Industry Member with respect to CAT Fees charged to such Industry Member pursuant to the Consolidated Audit Trail Funding Fees, including disputes related to the designated tier and the fee calculated pursuant to such tier, shall be resolved by the Operating Committee, or a Subcommittee designated by the Operating Committee, of the CAT NMS Plan, pursuant to the Fee Dispute Resolution Procedures adopted pursuant to the CAT NMS Plan and set forth in paragraph (c) of Proposed Rule 4.17.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Under these Procedures, an Industry Member that disputes CAT Fees charged to such Industry Member and that desires to have an opportunity to be heard with respect to such disputed CAT Fees must file a written application with the Company within 15 business days after being notified of such disputed CAT Fees. The application must identify the disputed CAT Fees, state the specific reasons why the applicant takes exception to such CAT Fees, and set forth the relief sought. In addition, if the applicant intends to submit any additional documents, statements, arguments or other material in support of the application, the same should be so stated and identified.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Company will refer applications for hearing and review promptly to the Subcommittee designated by the Operating Committee pursuant to Section 4.12 of the CAT NMS Plan with responsibility for conducting the reviews of CAT Fee disputes pursuant to these Procedures. This Subcommittee will be referred to as the Fee Review Subcommittee. The members of the Fee Review Subcommittee will be subject to the provisions of Section 4.3(d) of the CAT NMS Plan regarding recusal and Conflicts of Interest. The Fee Review Subcommittee will keep a record of the proceedings.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Fee Review Subcommittee will hold hearings promptly. The Fee Review Subcommittee will set a hearing date. The parties to the hearing shall furnish the Fee Review Subcommittee with all materials relevant to the proceedings at least 72 hours prior to the date of the hearing. Each party will have the right to inspect and copy the other party's materials prior to the hearing.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The parties to the hearing will consist of the applicant and a representative of the Company who shall present the reasons for the action taken by the Company that allegedly aggrieved the applicant. The applicant is entitled to be accompanied, represented and advised by counsel at all stages of the proceedings.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Fee Review Subcommittee will determine all questions concerning the admissibility of evidence and will otherwise regulate the conduct of the hearing. Each of the parties will be permitted to make an opening statement, present witnesses and documentary evidence, cross examine opposing witnesses and present closing arguments orally or in writing as determined by the Fee Review Subcommittee. The Fee Review Subcommittee also will have the right to question all parties and witnesses to the proceeding. The Fee Review Subcommittee must keep a record of the hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Fee Review Subcommittee must set forth its decision in writing and send the written decision to the parties to the proceeding. Such decisions will contain the reasons supporting the conclusions of the Fee Review Subcommittee.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The decision of the Fee Review Subcommittee will be subject to review by the Operating Committee either on its own motion within 20 business days after issuance of the decision or upon written request submitted by the applicant within 15 business days after issuance of the decision. The applicant's petition must be in writing and must specify the findings and conclusions to which the applicant objects, together with the reasons for such objections. Any objection to a decision not specified in writing will be considered to have been abandoned and may be disregarded. Parties may petition to submit a written argument to the Operating Committee and may request an opportunity to make an oral argument before the Operating <?page num="26531"?>Committee. The Operating Committee will have sole discretion to grant or deny either request.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Operating Committee will conduct the review. The review will be made upon the record and will be made after such further proceedings, if any, as the Operating Committee may order. Based upon such record, the Operating Committee may affirm, reverse or modify, in whole or in part, the decision of the Fee Review Subcommittee. The decision of the Operating Committee will be in writing, will be sent to the parties to the proceeding and will be final.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Procedures state that a final decision regarding the disputed CAT Fees by the Operating Committee, or the Fee Review Subcommittee (if there is no review by the Operating Committee), must be provided within 90 days of the date on which the Industry Member filed a written application regarding disputed CAT Fees with the Company. The Operating Committee may extend the 90-day time limit at its discretion.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, the Procedures state that any notices or other documents may be served upon the applicant either personally or by leaving the same at its, his or her place of business or by deposit in the United States post office, postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, addressed to the applicant at its, his or her last known business or residence address. The Procedures also state that any time limits imposed under the Procedures for the submission of answers, petitions or other materials may be extended by permission of the Operating Committee. All papers and documents relating to review by the Fee Review Subcommittee or the Operating Committee must be submitted to the Fee Review Subcommittee or Operating Committee, as applicable.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Procedures also note that decisions on such CAT Fee disputes made pursuant to these Procedures will be binding on Industry Members, without prejudice to the rights of any such Industry Member to seek redress from the SEC or in any other appropriate forum.






 </p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Finally, an Industry Member that files a written application with the Company regarding disputed CAT Fees in accordance with these Procedures is not required to pay such disputed CAT Fees until the dispute is resolved in accordance with these Procedures, including any review by the SEC or in any other appropriate forum. For these purposes, the disputed CAT Fees means the amount of the invoiced CAT Fees that the Industry Member has asserted pursuant to these Procedures that such Industry Member does not owe to the Company. The Industry Member must pay any invoiced CAT Fees that are not disputed CAT Fees when due as set forth in the original invoice.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Once the dispute regarding CAT Fees is resolved pursuant to these Procedures, if it is determined that the Industry Member owes any of the disputed CAT Fees, then the Industry Member must pay such disputed CAT Fees that are owed as well as interest on such disputed CAT Fees from the original due date (that is, 30 days after receipt of the original invoice of such CAT Fees) until such disputed CAT Fees are paid at a per annum rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Prime Rate plus 300 basis points, or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

The Exchange notes that the proposed rule change implements Section 11.5 of the CAT NMS Plan approved by the Commission, and is designed to assist the Exchange in meeting its regulatory obligations pursuant to the Plan. Similarly, all national securities exchanges and FINRA are proposing this proposed rule to implement the requirements of the CAT NMS Plan. Therefore, this is not a competitive rule filing and, therefore, it does not raise competition issues between and among the exchanges and FINRA.

The Exchange believes the proposed change is not unfairly discriminatory because the proposed benchmark of TCADV is tied to the amount of monthly volume executed on the Exchange, which would incentivize and reward consistent order flow month-to-month. The Exchange notes that other options exchanges likewise utilize percentages of market share as a benchmark in determining eligibility for monthly [sic] certain credits or rebates.<ref id="fnd2e16286" idref="fnd2e16295" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">10</ref> The Exchange also believes the proposed change would help to prevent LMMs from achieving the Discount only during periods of heavy volumes or from being penalized (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> not achieving the Discount) during months of overall lower volumes on the Exchange. The Exchange notes that there is only one LMM per issue, and only LMMs are subject to the LMM Rights Fee, therefore the proposed discount is not unfairly discriminatory.

Paragraph (a)(1) of Proposed Rule 16100 states that, for purposes of Rule 16100, the terms “CAT NMS Plan”, “Industry Member”, “Operating Committee”, and “Participant” are defined as set forth in the Rule 16010 (Consolidated Audit Trail—Definitions), and the term “CAT Fee” is defined as set forth in the Consolidated Audit Trail Funding Fees. In addition, SRO proposes to add paragraph (a)(2) to Proposed Rule 16100. New paragraph (a)(2) would define the term “Subcommittee” to mean a subcommittee designated by the Operating Committee pursuant to the CAT NMS Plan.

Section 11.5 of the CAT NMS Plan also states that decisions by the Operating Committee or Subcommittee on such matters shall be binding on Industry Members, without prejudice to the right of any Industry Member to seek redress from the SEC pursuant to SEC Rule 608 or in any other appropriate forum. SRO proposes to adopt paragraph (b) of Proposed Rule 16100. Paragraph (b) of Proposed Rule 16100 states that disputes initiated by an Industry Member with respect to CAT Fees charged to such Industry Member pursuant to the Consolidated Audit Trail Funding Fees, including disputes related to the designated tier and the fee calculated pursuant to such tier, shall be resolved by the Operating Committee, or a Subcommittee designated by the Operating Committee, of the CAT NMS Plan, pursuant to the Fee Dispute Resolution Procedures adopted pursuant to the CAT NMS Plan and set forth in paragraph (c) of Proposed Rule 16100.

The application must identify the disputed CAT Fees, state the specific reasons why the applicant takes exception to such CAT Fees, and set forth the relief sought. In addition, if the applicant intends to submit any additional documents, statements, arguments or other material in support of the application, the same should be so stated and identified.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Company will refer applications for hearing and review promptly to the Subcommittee designated by the Operating Committee pursuant to Section 4.12 of the CAT NMS Plan with responsibility for conducting the reviews of CAT Fee disputes pursuant to these Procedures. This Subcommittee will be referred to as the Fee Review Subcommittee. The members of the Fee Review Subcommittee will be subject to the provisions of Section 4.3(d) of the CAT NMS Plan regarding recusal and Conflicts of Interest.

Each of the parties will be permitted to make an opening statement, present witnesses and documentary evidence, cross examine opposing witnesses and present closing arguments orally or in writing as determined by the Fee Review Subcommittee. The Fee Review Subcommittee also will have the right to question all parties and witnesses to the proceeding. The Fee Review Subcommittee must keep a record of the hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Fee Review Subcommittee must set forth its decision in writing and send the written decision to the parties to the proceeding. Such decisions will contain the reasons supporting the conclusions of the Fee Review Subcommittee.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The decision of the Fee Review Subcommittee will be subject to review by the Operating Committee either on its own motion within 20 business days after issuance of the decision or upon written request submitted by the applicant within 15 business days after issuance of the decision.

Any objection to a decision not specified in writing will be considered to have been abandoned and may be disregarded. Parties may petition to submit a written argument to the Operating Committee and may request an opportunity to make an oral argument before the Operating Committee.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Operating Committee will conduct the review.

Based upon such record, the Operating Committee may affirm, reverse or modify, in whole or in part, the decision of the Fee Review Subcommittee. The decision of the Operating Committee will be in writing, will be sent to the parties to the proceeding and will be final.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Procedures state that a final decision regarding the disputed CAT Fees by the Operating Committee, or the Fee Review Subcommittee (if there is no review by the Operating Committee), must be provided within 90 days of the date on which the Industry Member filed a written application regarding disputed CAT Fees with the Company. The Operating Committee may extend the 90-day time limit at its discretion.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, the Procedures state that any notices or other documents may be served upon the applicant either personally or by leaving the same at its, his or her place of business or by deposit in the United States post office, postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, addressed to the applicant at its, his or her last known business or residence address. The Procedures also state that any time limits imposed under the Procedures for the submission of answers, petitions or other materials may be extended by permission of the Operating Committee. All papers and documents relating to review by the Fee Review Subcommittee or the Operating Committee must be submitted to the Fee Review Subcommittee or Operating Committee, as applicable.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Procedures also note that decisions on such CAT Fee disputes made pursuant to these Procedures will be binding on Industry Members, without prejudice to the rights of any such Industry Member to seek redress from the SEC or in any other appropriate forum.






 </p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Finally, an Industry Member that files a written application with the Company regarding disputed CAT Fees in accordance with these Procedures is not required to pay such disputed CAT Fees until the dispute is resolved in accordance with these Procedures, including any review by the SEC or in any other appropriate forum. For these purposes, the disputed CAT Fees means the amount of the invoiced CAT Fees that the Industry Member has asserted pursuant to these Procedures that such Industry Member does not owe to the Company. The Industry Member must pay any invoiced CAT Fees that are not disputed CAT Fees when due as set forth in the original invoice.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Once the dispute regarding CAT Fees is resolved pursuant to these Procedures, if it is determined that the Industry Member owes any of the disputed CAT Fees, then the Industry Member must pay such disputed CAT Fees that are owed as well as interest on such disputed CAT Fees from the original due date (that is, 30 days after receipt of the original invoice of such CAT Fees) until such disputed CAT Fees are paid at a per annum rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Prime Rate plus 300 basis points, or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange notes that the proposed rule change implements Section 11.5 of the CAT NMS Plan approved by the Commission, and is designed to assist the Exchange in meeting its regulatory obligations pursuant to the Plan. Similarly, all national securities exchanges and FINRA are proposing this proposed rule to implement the requirements of the CAT NMS Plan. Therefore, this is not a competitive rule filing and, therefore, it does not raise competition issues between and among the exchanges and FINRA.

Paragraph (a)(1) of Proposed Rule 4.17 states that, for purposes of Rule 4.17, the terms “CAT NMS Plan”, “Industry Member”, “Operating Committee”, and “Participant” are defined as set forth in the Rule 4.5 (Consolidated Audit Trail—Definitions), and the term “CAT Fee” is defined as set forth in the Consolidated Audit Trail Funding Fees. In addition, the Exchange proposes to add paragraph (a)(2) to Proposed Rule 4.17. New paragraph (a)(2) would define the term “Subcommittee” to mean a subcommittee designated by the Operating Committee pursuant to the CAT NMS Plan.

Section 11.5 of the CAT NMS Plan also states that decisions by the Operating Committee or Subcommittee on such matters shall be binding on Industry Members, without prejudice to the right of any Industry Member to seek redress from the SEC pursuant to SEC Rule 608 or in any other appropriate forum. The Exchange proposes to adopt paragraph (b) of Proposed Rule 4.17. Paragraph (b) of Proposed Rule 4.17 states that disputes initiated by an Industry Member with respect to CAT Fees charged to such Industry Member pursuant to the Consolidated Audit Trail Funding Fees, including disputes related to the designated tier and the fee calculated pursuant to such tier, shall be resolved by the Operating Committee, or a Subcommittee designated by the Operating Committee, of the CAT NMS Plan, pursuant to the Fee Dispute Resolution Procedures adopted pursuant to the CAT NMS Plan and set forth in paragraph (c) of Proposed Rule 4.17.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, the Procedures state that any notices or other documents may be served upon the applicant either personally or by leaving the same at its, his or her place of business or by deposit in the United States post office, postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, addressed to the applicant at its, his or her last known business or residence address. The Procedures also state that any time limits imposed under the Procedures for the submission of answers, petitions or other materials may be extended by permission of the Operating Committee.

For these purposes, the disputed CAT Fees means the amount of the invoiced CAT Fees that the Industry Member has asserted pursuant to these Procedures that such Industry Member does not owe to the Company. The Industry Member must pay any invoiced CAT Fees that are not disputed CAT Fees when due as set forth in the original invoice.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Once the dispute regarding CAT Fees is resolved pursuant to these Procedures, if it is determined that the Industry Member owes any of the disputed CAT Fees, then the Industry Member must pay such disputed CAT <?page num="26542"?>Fees that are owed as well as interest on such disputed CAT Fees from the original due date (that is, 30 days after receipt of the original invoice of such CAT Fees) until such disputed CAT Fees are paid at a per annum rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Prime Rate plus 300 basis points, or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange notes that the proposed rule change implements Section 11.5 of the CAT NMS Plan approved by the Commission, and is designed to assist the Exchange in meeting its regulatory obligations pursuant to the Plan. Similarly, all national securities exchanges and FINRA are proposing this proposed rule to implement the requirements of the CAT NMS Plan. Therefore, this is not a competitive rule filing and, therefore, it does not raise competition issues between and among the exchanges and FINRA.

                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Fee Review Subcommittee must set forth its decision in writing and send the written decision to the parties to the proceeding. Such decisions will contain the reasons supporting the conclusions of the Fee Review Subcommittee.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The decision of the Fee Review Subcommittee will be subject to review by the Operating Committee either on its own motion within 20 business days after issuance of the decision or upon written request submitted by the applicant within 15 business days after issuance of the decision. The applicant's petition must be in writing and must specify the findings and conclusions to which the applicant objects, together with the reasons for such objections. Any objection to a decision not specified in writing will be considered to have been abandoned and may be disregarded. Parties may petition to submit a written argument to the Operating Committee and may request an opportunity to make an oral argument before the Operating Committee. The Operating Committee will have sole discretion to grant or deny either request.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Operating Committee will conduct the review. The review will be made upon the record and will be made after such further proceedings, if any, as the Operating Committee may order. Based upon such record, the Operating Committee may affirm, reverse or modify, in whole or in part, the decision of the Fee Review Subcommittee. The decision of the Operating Committee will be in writing, will be sent to the parties to the proceeding and will be final.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Procedures state that a final decision regarding the disputed CAT Fees by the Operating Committee, or the Fee Review Subcommittee (if there is no review by the Operating Committee), must be provided within 90 days of the date on which the Industry Member filed a written application regarding disputed CAT Fees with the Company. The Operating Committee may extend the 90-day time limit at its discretion.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">In addition, the Procedures state that any notices or other documents may be served upon the applicant either personally or by leaving the same at its, his or her place of business or by deposit in the United States post office, postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, addressed to the applicant at its, his or her last known business or residence address. The Procedures also state that any time limits imposed under the Procedures for the submission of answers, petitions or other materials may be extended by permission of the Operating Committee. All papers and documents relating to review by the Fee Review Subcommittee or the Operating Committee must be submitted to the Fee Review Subcommittee or Operating Committee, as applicable.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The Procedures also note that decisions on such CAT Fee disputes made pursuant to these Procedures will be binding on Industry Members, without prejudice to the rights of any such Industry Member to seek redress from the SEC or in any other appropriate forum.







 </p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Finally, an Industry Member that files a written application with the Company regarding disputed CAT Fees in accordance with these Procedures is not required to pay such disputed CAT Fees until the dispute is resolved in accordance with these Procedures, including any review by the SEC or in any other appropriate forum. For these purposes, the disputed CAT Fees means <?page num="26545"?>the amount of the invoiced CAT Fees that the Industry Member has asserted pursuant to these Procedures that such Industry Member does not owe to the Company. The Industry Member must pay any invoiced CAT Fees that are not disputed CAT Fees when due as set forth in the original invoice.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Once the dispute regarding CAT Fees is resolved pursuant to these Procedures, if it is determined that the Industry Member owes any of the disputed CAT Fees, then the Industry Member must pay such disputed CAT Fees that are owed as well as interest on such disputed CAT Fees from the original due date (that is, 30 days after receipt of the original invoice of such CAT Fees) until such disputed CAT Fees are paid at a per annum rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Prime Rate plus 300 basis points, or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange notes that the proposed rule change implements Section 11.5 of the CAT NMS Plan approved by the Commission, and is designed to assist the Exchange in meeting its regulatory obligations pursuant to the Plan. Similarly, all national securities exchanges and FINRA are proposing this proposed rule to implement the requirements of the CAT NMS Plan. Therefore, this is not a competitive rule filing and, therefore, it does not raise competition issues between and among the exchanges and FINRA.

In connection with the establishment of the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF, FINRA and Nasdaq, Inc. entered into a limited liability company agreement (the “LLC Agreement”).<ref id="fnd2e18318" idref="fnd2e18324" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">5</ref> Under the LLC Agreement, FINRA, the “SRO Member,” has sole regulatory responsibility for the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF. Nasdaq, Inc., the “Business Member,” is primarily responsible for the management of the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF's business affairs, including establishing pricing for use of the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF, to the extent those affairs are not inconsistent with the regulatory and oversight functions of FINRA. Additionally, the Business Member is obligated to pay the cost of regulation and is entitled to the profits and losses, if any, derived from the operation of the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF.

Paragraph (a)(1) of Proposed Rule 4.17 states that, for purposes of Rule 4.17, the terms “CAT NMS Plan”, “Industry Member”, “Operating Committee”, and “Participant” are defined as set forth in the Rule 4.5 (Consolidated Audit Trail—Definitions), and the term “CAT Fee” is defined as set forth in the Consolidated Audit Trail Funding Fees. In addition, the Exchange proposes to add paragraph (a)(2) to Proposed Rule 4.17.

For these purposes, the disputed CAT Fees means the amount of the invoiced CAT Fees that the Industry Member has asserted pursuant to these Procedures that such Industry Member does not owe to the Company. The Industry Member must pay any invoiced CAT Fees that are not disputed CAT Fees when due as set forth in the original invoice.
</p>
                                 <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">Once the dispute regarding CAT Fees is resolved pursuant to these Procedures, if it is determined that the Industry Member owes any of the disputed CAT Fees, then the Industry Member must pay such disputed CAT Fees that are owed as well as interest on such disputed CAT Fees from the original due date (that is, 30 days after receipt of the original invoice of such CAT Fees) until such disputed CAT Fees are paid at a per annum rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Prime Rate plus 300 basis points, or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange notes that the proposed rule change implements Section 11.5 of the CAT NMS Plan approved by the Commission, and is designed to assist the Exchange in meeting its regulatory obligations pursuant to the Plan. Similarly, all national securities exchanges and FINRA are proposing this proposed rule to implement the requirements of the CAT NMS Plan. Therefore, this is not a competitive rule filing and, therefore, it does not raise competition issues between and among the exchanges and FINRA.

Currently, Rule 11.330(a)(2) states that the IEX Data Platform is a data feed, available through the Exchange's public Web site, that offers aggregated top of book quotations for all displayed orders resting on the Order Book, aggregated depth of book quotations for all displayed orders resting on the Order Book for up to ten (10) price levels, and execution information (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> last sale information) for executions on the Exchange. The Exchange believes that market participants that make use of the IEX Data Platform would benefit from receiving all aggregated depth of book quotations for all orders resting on the Order Book at every price level, in the same manner that such information is disseminated over IEX DEEP.<ref id="fnd2e18939" idref="fnd2e18948" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">4</ref> Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to amend Rule 11.330(a)(2) to offer aggregated depth of book quotations on the IEX Data Platform for all displayed orders resting on the Order Book at each price level, rather than providing only ten (10) price levels. The IEX Data Platform will continue to offer aggregated top of book quotations for all displayed orders resting on the Order Book, and execution information (<inline style="-uslm-sgm:E" class="-gpo-grid-0-3">i.e.,</inline> last sale information) for executions on the Exchange. Furthermore, the IEX Data Platform will continue to be provided free of charge. In addition, after informal discussions with market participants and other users, the Exchange has determined that there is demand for historical market data related to quotations and transaction information on the Exchange. Accordingly, the Exchange is proposing to offer HIST, a data product that offers historical data for download from the Exchange's public Web site. HIST will include the same substantive data that is provided in real time via TOPS and DEEP on a T+1 basis via the Exchange's public Web site, free of charge.

Furthermore, HIST will provide market participants, academics, and other users, the ability to analyze and make use of the Exchange's historical quotations and transaction information, thereby promoting transparency and accessibility to Exchange data products for a variety of purposes. For instance, data recipients that wish to back-test certain trading strategies can use HIST for such a purpose. As another example, data recipients that provide market information through public Web sites or develop dynamic stock tickers, portfolio trackers, price/time graphs and other visual systems can also use HIST for such purposes. The Exchange notes that similar historical data products are offered by other market centers.<ref id="fnd2e19024" idref="fnd2e19030" style="-uslm-sgm:SU">10</ref> The Exchange also believes this proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act because it is designed to protect investors and the public interest and promote just and equitable principles of trade by providing greater transparency regarding displayed orders in the IEX System on a historical basis through HIST and in real-time through the IEX Data Platform. Further, the proposal would not permit unfair discrimination because the information will be available to all market participants and market data vendors on an equivalent basis, and without charge.

Each time an Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment Transaction for an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Fund that falls within a Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies, the Regulated Fund's Adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for such Regulated Fund in light of the Regulated Fund's then-current circumstances.

The applicable Adviser will provide the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Fund with information concerning each participating party's available capital to assist the Eligible Directors with their review of the Regulated Fund's investments for compliance with these allocation procedures.
</p>
                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">(c) After making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the applicable Adviser will distribute written information concerning the Potential Co-Investment Transaction (including the amount proposed to be invested by each participating Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Fund for their consideration.

The Program is currently limited to trades occurring at prices equal to or greater than $1.00 per share. Under the Program, Retail Liquidity Providers (“RLPs”) are able to provide potential price improvement in the form of a non-displayed order that is priced better than the Exchange's best protected bid or offer (“PBBO”), called a Retail Price Improvement Order (“RPI”). When there is an RPI in a particular security, the Exchange disseminates an indicator, known as the Retail Liquidity Identifier, indicating that such interest exists. Retail Member Organizations (“RMOs”) can submit a Retail Order to the Exchange, which would interact, to the extent possible, with available contra-side RPIs.

Such competition has the ability to promote efficiency by facilitating the price discovery process and generating additional investor interest in trading securities, thereby promoting capital formation.

The Exchange believes that extending the pilot period for the Retail Liquidity Program is consistent with these principles because the Program is reasonably designed to attract retail order flow to the exchange environment, while helping to ensure that retail investors benefit from the better price that liquidity providers are willing to give their orders. Additionally, as previously stated, the competition promoted by the Program may facilitate the price discovery process and potentially generate additional investor interest in trading securities. The extension of the pilot period will allow the Commission and the Exchange to continue to monitor the Program for its potential effects on public price discovery, and on the broader market structure.

                                       <p style="-uslm-sgm:P">The DOS is implementing a higher initial maximum uniform allowance to procure and issue uniform items for special agent personnel within the DS/T/MSD. This is being established in accordance with <ref href="/us/cfr/t5/s591.104">5 CFR 591.104</ref>, which states that an agency may establish one or more initial maximum uniform allowance rates greater than the government-wide maximum uniform allowance rate established under <ref href="/us/cfr/t5/s591.103">5 CFR 591.103</ref>. The current $800.00 limit has become inadequate to maintain the uniform standards and professional image expected of Diplomatic Service special agents whom serve within DS/T/MSD. The uniform items for DS/T/MSD special agent personnel include the following items or similar items such as: Battle dress uniform pants, hot weather top and blouses; heavy duty battle dress uniform; cloth uniform insignia patches, and cloth uniform badges. The average total uniform cost for the listed items is $1,400.00. Based on these current costs, the DOS is increasing the initial maximum uniform allowance for DOS special agents in DS/T/MSD to $1,400.00. The number of DOS special agents in DS/T/MSD affected by this change would be approximately 125 employees.

Enplanement data contained in Schedule T–100/T–100(f) are the sole data base used by the FAA in determining airport funding. U.S. airports receiving significant service from foreign air carriers operating small aircraft could be receiving less than their fair share of AIP entitlement funds. Collecting Schedule T–100(f) data for small aircraft operations will enable the FAA to more fairly distribute these funds.

In making these determinations, the proposed transaction's effect on competition in the markets served by the affected air carriers is analyzed. This analysis includes, among other things, a consideration of the volume of traffic and available capacity, the flight segments and origins-destinations involved, and the existence of entry barriers, such as limited airport slots or gate capacity. Also included is a review of the volume of traffic handled by each air carrier at specific airports and in specific markets which would be affected by the proposed acquisition or merger. The Justice Department uses T–100 data in carrying out its responsibilities relating to airline competition and consolidation.

It is a predictive measure which indicates potential capacity problems, delays, and possible airport expansions or runway construction needs. If the level of operations at an airport exceeds PANCAP significantly, the frequency and length of delays will increase, with a potential concurrent risk of accidents. Under this program, the FAA develops ways of increasing airport capacity at congested airports.

Section 37 provides that banks should state clearly the definition of capital used in any aspect of its internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) and document any changes in the internal definition of capital. Section 41 provides that banks should maintain thorough documentation of ICAAP. Section 43 specifies that the board of director should approve the bank's ICAAP, review it on a regular basis, and approve any changes. Boards of directors, under section 46, should periodically review the assessment of overall capital adequacy and to analyze how measures of internal capital adequacy compare with other capital measures (such as regulatory or accounting).

The forms collect data on the foreign exchange spot, forward, futures, and options markets from all significant market participants.

Two changes have been made in the instructions to provide additional clarity on who must file the reports. The changes will impact the instructions for all three of the forms. Specifically, (1) In section B, Who Must Report, the last sentence of the first paragraph now reads: “The calculation of exposure against the Form FC–1 [FC–2, FC–3] reporting threshold should include foreign exchange contracts in all currencies and should not be limited to contracts in the indicated currencies on the Form FC–1 [FC–2, FC–3].” (2) In section C, Filing the Reports, the last sentence of paragraph C.1 now reads: “The reporter is required to file the Form FC–1 [FC–2, FC–3] until the reporter's contracts have remained below the reporting threshold for all four quarters of a calendar year.”
