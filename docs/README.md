# USLM Documentation Directory

This directory contains an experimental effort to reorganize and enhance the existing USLM (United States Legislative Markup) documentation. The goal is to create a more structured and accessible documentation system by combining original user guides with review guides (changelogs) and generating new documentation from XSD schema files.

## Purpose

This is a **new, experimental effort** being shared for comment and in case it's helpful to anyone. The documentation is being reorganized to:

- Merge original User Guides with Review Guides (changelogs) for comprehensive version information
- Generate new documentation directly from XSD schema files
- Create a more navigable structure for different USLM versions
- Provide both human-readable and machine-generated documentation
